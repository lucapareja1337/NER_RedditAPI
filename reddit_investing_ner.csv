&amp;#x200B;

Currently I have an automatic transfer from checking into a brokerage account of $270 (270 x 52 weeks = \~14k to max Roth for January 2025) But with Schwab I can't 'auto invest' in their money market funds to get 5.25+% on cash sitting in there... I have to 'manually' buy each week (an annoying hassle but whatever). My other issue/problem with the money sitting in there is it is not invested as I am waiting to invest it for the next January.

This has me thinking... why cant i setup an auto invest in my brokerage account weekly of the $270 in a total market ETF (SWTSX) so that it is actually invested in the market. (this will allow for automation and to be invested every day of the year with these weekly funds)

&amp;#x200B;

Potential issues I have reviewed:

\&gt;If there is a gain in value... short term capital gains would be taxed at my marginal tax bracket in the brokerage account as the investment in the brokerage would be sold within 1 year. But this is the same tax rate that any interest would be taxed at if earned in a money market fund, HYSA, savings, etc

\&gt;If there is no change in value.... lost potential of interest elsewhere but just like money in Roth it can go up, stay the same, or go down and long term it doesn't matter.

\&gt;If there is a loss in value.... I am ok just like I am with losing money on Roth dollars and the difference in value I will make up with new money later on to max the Roth. Plus I can Tax loss harvest and get a slight tax break. (Being careful of any wash sale rules as I will be selling to buy the same investment once money is in Roth so at least 31 days later)

But, the least volatile 20% US domestic stocks have a statistically significant higher long term return when compared to the most volatile 20%.  That's a significantly higher absolute return, not just risk adjusted return.   The same anomaly had been found in international markets all over the world.  And in many different historical time periods too.  The anomaly has even been found in assets other than stocks.

Global low volatility funds have volatility levels lower than even 70/30 traditional global stock/domestic bond portfolios.  In other words, a 65/35 VT/BND portfolio has a similar volatility level to a 100% global low volatility portfolio.  

Global low volatility funds also avoid most concentration risk.  VMNVX (vanguard global minimum volatility admiral), for example, has all individual stocks well below 2% of total funds.
VMNVX also has the lowest expense ratio of the fund type.  And, unlike other low volatility funds, it is currency hedged, further reducing risk.

Example from: [https://www.morningstar.com/portfolios/experts-forecast-stock-bond-returns-2023-edition](https://www.morningstar.com/portfolios/experts-forecast-stock-bond-returns-2023-edition)

I don’t even know why the official term is, but basically they claim to have a system or algorithm or whatever and they invest your money and take a cut of returns. This one in particular claims to consistently beat the market. I would like to know this community’s opinion on this type of investment.

I feel like there could be an advantage to having a team of people constantly researching companies and looking for value. I don’t have the time or training to do that myself, so if you find a team that is good at it maybe they are worth it. But yes, obviously they will charge more than if you just did low cost index tracking ETFs or mutual funds.

If anyone does use these types of services, can you please share some techniques for evaluating the family office itself to make sure it’s legit? I think some of them actually take possession of your money, which is scary and could result in total loss, whereas others use more like an escrow service so you can’t get rug pulled and you can withdraw at any time without needing their permission? I’m just dipping my toe into this so any advice will be appreciated.

Also I know this sub prefers total stock ETFs and all that, don’t try to beat the market, long term horizon, blah blah blah. If your comment is just going to recommend me that strategy don’t worry, I already know and use it for the bulk of my portfolio.

t3_196g9xn|1705240114.0|investing|How could fundamental analysis based investing ever work?|"From my understanding, the idea behind fundamental analysis investing is that there is a way to determine the *real* value of a stock and then compare that to the current market price of the stock. If the stock's *real* value (as determined by varying criteria such as quarterly earnings or P/E and the like) is lower than its current price then we know we should buy the stock and then sell it when that *real* value matches or exceeds the current market price.

If my understanding is correct, I don't see how this strategy could ever work. Here's why:

**Option 1:** All investors use the same criteria to determine *real* value. If everyone is using the same criteria as you are then they will see that the stock is undervalued just like you would see and so they would invest (likely before you get a chance to) and bring the current price up to its *real* price. This would mean that all stocks are constantly accurately valued and that all *real* prices match current prices. Thus fundamental analysis would provide no benefit to an investor.

**Option 2:** All investors use different criteria to determine *real* value. If everyone uses different criteria to determine *real* value of a stock then you might know that a stock is undervalued before almost anybody else since you selected the *correct* criteria while others used *incorrect* criteria. The issue is that even if you know that a stock is undervalued by your own criteria, if nobody else knows this (since they used other criteria from you) then the stock's price will not increase. If the price doesn't increase it will remain at its current price even though you know that it's *real* price is higher. Thus in this case as well, fundamental analysis would provide no benefit to an investor.

**Potential but problematic answer**: The only way fundamental analysis could benefit an investor that I can think of, is if people use different criteria (option 2) and some use objectively correct criteria for determining the *real* price of a stock. If only some investors are using the *correct* methods and others buy the stock for no reason (or at least not based on *correct* fundamental analysis that somehow still led them to buy the same stock but later than the original investors) then the stock price would rise and the original investors would benefit. But if there are objective criteria for predicting stocks, how have they not been fully discovered and adopted by all major investors? That is, if there is a way to 'see through the matrix' and evaluate stocks in a consistently successful manner that is nonobvious to other investors, it would certainly become the most common way to evaluate a stock, thereby rendering it fully ineffective. For this problematic answer to be true there would need to be a *correct* list of criteria relevant for evaluating stocks that is either kept highly secret or that is known but that is ignored by most investors. Both these seem highly unlikely to me.

Any answer to this puzzle that is better than my problematic answer would be greatly appreciated. Any direction towards research or articles that answer this question would be great too. Thanks."|0.47|0.0|0.0|0.0|[]

Can't contribute directly to roth due to income. I opened both traditional and roth IRAs with Robinhood in 2023 to make backdoor contributions to the roth. I've been contributing approx $540 a month to the tradional, and then immediately converting to roth to hit the 6500 in 2023.

RH was sending me notifications that I had till Jan 31, 2024 to earn an extra 1% on any funds rolled over from other IRAs or 401ks. I have a previous employer 401k that was just sitting and wanted to move that over to RH for a couple reasons:

1. To capitalize on the 1% match RH was offering
2. More control on what I was invested in - The funds they were offering weren't the ones that I really wanted, so I was hoping to move the $ into RH and start buying VOO, QQQM, AVUV

Let's say I had 100k in the 401k which was comprised of 70% roth and 30% traditional from the employer match. I don't see an issue with the roth being rolled over. However, for the traditional portion, I just read this morning in another thread that the IRS looks at the entirety of your traditional IRAs when determining if you get taxed on any conversions to roth IRAs.

so if I rolled 30k over into the traditional IRA, and I contribute post tax 7k into the traditional IRA this for 2024 - when I convert the 7k to roth, will I get taxed on that 7k? Meaning it would look like I did a roth conversion on 7k out of 37k (or around 18.9%) of my total traditional IRA, so then I would be taxed on 18.9% of my conversion. Does my assumption sound right? Sound like I'll be double taxed on a portion of what I'm trying to invest.

Open to any suggestions. Thanks in advance!

edit: for clarification, I already initiated the roll over from the 401k to RH and checks were cut, currently being mailed to RH.

In my view this article puts both those arguments to rest by quantifying the competition, and by providing actual unit/revenue history paired with a segment perspective from non biased, long time industry observer.

t3_195p887|1705156287.0|investing|Why cryptocurrencies are actually investment pyramids|"Suppose you write the number 100 on a piece of paper. Did you create money by doing so? Namely, when we look at what is today called money (euros, dollars, pounds), it is just paper with numbers. The same applies to deposits in banks. They are numbers - it is just they are not on paper but on a digital medium. So, do you create money by writing a number on a paper? Of course not. The idea that money is created by just putting numbers on paper or digital media is a popular myth.

For numbers to be money, they must be redeemable. What does that mean? Let's say that your paper with the number 100 is a security that entitles the bearer to 100 kg of wheat. You are actually a farmer and have issued a paper with the number 100 indicating a specific amount of wheat that you will give to whoever brings that paper. That means that the number 100 is redeemable. That it has redemption value. You as the issuer of the number took the liability. By taking liability you gave value to that number. As such, the number can be money because based on the size of that liability it can be determined how much goods and services are worth giving for it.

Euros, dollars or pounds work similarly. They are indeed numbers, but redeemable numbers. They have redemption value. Their issuers - commercial and central banks redeem them for debt servicing and liens release. This is because these numbers are issued as debt. Individuals and companies owe it to commercial banks based on loans, while governments owe it to central banks based on bonds. That is why banks have the liability to redeem these numbers, which is clearly shown in their accounting books. They have liability to redeem them for reducing or closing the said debt and releasing liens on the property that secures it. So, if an individual can remove a lien from a car title by giving the number 20,000 to the bank that issued it, the value of that number is somewhere in the range of the car's value. And that's why that number is money. Based on the size of the liability behind it we can determine how much goods and services are worth giving for it.

Now we finally come to cryptocurrencies. They are said to be money. Given the above, let's see if this is true. When you buy a cryptocurrency, all you receive is a number next to the name of that cryptocurrency. For example '5.4321' BTC. But is that number redeemable by its issuer? Does it have redemption value? Has its issuer took the liability to redeem it for something? In the case of Bitcoin, the issuer is Satoshi Nakamoto. Has he took the liability to redeem the units and sub-units of the number 21 million that he issues through the protocol he authored? Well, no. He took no such liability. His numbers have no redemption value. That's why is impossible to determined how much goods and services are worth giving for them. Or to put it simply, they are not money.

There is a well-known example of the pizzeria owner who gave two pizzas for the number 10,000. Why did he accept that number and not 1, 1,000 or 100,000? Well, there is no rational reason. He did that blindly. He had no redemption value as a reference to determine whether or not it was worth giving two pizzas for a specific number, which is why he accepted 10,000 completely arbitrarily.

So what Satoshi Nakamoto came up with and what various cryptocurrency authors are copying are not payment or monetary systems. Instead, they are investment pyramids. They attract participants by misrepresenting non-redeemable numbers as money. Also, they are wrapped in cellophane of cryptography and decentralization, which gives them the appearance of seriousness.

The whole thing works in the following way. A crypto author uses their imagination to come up with a number - 21 million in the case of Bitcoin. Then, they simply write a protocol that attributes units and subunits of that number to addresses of users that maintain the system. Numbers are cryptographically protected and stored in a decentralized database. Other users then register into the system and exchange the numbers thinking they are making ""secure online payments"". They think they are part of a modern payment system, that they are ""using money"". But in reality, they just participate in the modern investment pyramid. Cryptocurrencies are pyramid schemes where participants pay in redeemable numbers (EUR, USD, GBP...), goods, or services and in return they get non-redeemable numbers (BTC, ETH, DODGE...). Due to the lack of redemption value, if the payments into the schemes stop, everything collapses and the participants are left with nothing. Just as this is the case with all investment pyramids."|0.36|0.0|0.0|0.0|['DODGE', 'ETH', 'EUR', 'USD', 'GBP', 'pizzeria']
t3_195mq9a|1705148107.0|investing|More than 50x investing in art|"This is the story of how I multiplied my investment by more than 50x by buying art.

 This is the story of how I became an art dealer. I am Brazilian, 36 years old, a marketer with an MBA in marketing and branding. In 2020, I owned two barbershops in my city, with an annual turnover of approximately 350k USD. Like many others, we had to close during the pandemic, and I found myself newly married and without income. I tried to think of various new businesses, played online poker, battled depression, and in the midst of it all, I saw an opportunity: investing in art.

Art has always been a passion in my life. My mother, who had me at 16, had her first degree in Fine Arts. So, when she had no one to leave me with, she took me to her art classes. I have many tattoos and a great appreciation for surrealism and Salvador Dalí. I even have his face tattooed on my left arm and the elephant with thin legs on my leg.

My original idea was to create a hybrid gallery (a marketplace and host exhibitions in non-traditional venues like restaurants, stores, and even my own barbershop). I started collecting various artists with this strategy in mind and held my first exhibition in the barbershop, but it resulted in zero sales. Three exhibitions in a friend's home decor store and another in a restaurant also resulted in no sales. I needed to learn from this—either my artworks didn't work, or I was in the wrong place.

During this journey, I pursued a new specialization in Art Business and learned more about how the art market operates. Brazil, being a third-world country with a significantly deflated currency compared to the dollar and euro (1 USD = approximately 4.85 Brazilian Reais), led me to a new theory: buy in Reais and sell in a strong currency. For this, I needed a truly unique product that would attract collectors worldwide.

Among the artists I started buying from, one stood out. This artist had over a million followers on social media and ticked all the validation points—mastery of technique, academic refinement, authentic work, and most importantly, customers! This artist released serialized sculptures (50 to 70 units per edition), and the prices increased with each sold-out batch, ranging from 200 USD to 1.5k USD in a matter of weeks. My mind exploded when I saw this. I seized the opportunity and bought three sculptures, two from the first batch and one from the second.

Over time, I observed the artist's creative process—creating a drawing, transforming it into a painting and/or sculpture. I concluded that if the serialized sculptures appreciated so quickly, why wouldn't the paintings that inspired them be equally valuable? It involved a higher investment, but the returns could be exponentially greater. All of his paintings were oil-based, taking months to complete and were unique.

I made my first painting acquisition and scheduled a trip to São Paulo to pick it up and meet the artist in person. In August 2021, during the pandemic, my wife and I visited the artist's old 300m² apartment, which served as both a studio and residence. This turned out to be the luckiest moment of my life, defined as being in the right place at the right time with the right vision and attitude. The artist had a dispute with his former art dealer, and I seized the opportunity, buying nine paintings with every penny I had.

In December of the same year, the artist invited me to exhibit my collection at his first major solo exhibition in São Paulo in April. He also granted me priority to buy new works and handle the pre-sale, earning a 20% commission on sales. Despite being financially tight, I sold 20 paintings to friends and family in four days, acquiring three more with my commission. I then founded a ""collectors' club,"" taking responsibility for the next sale and tasks related to exhibitions and artwork storage.

The São Paulo exhibition was incredible, attracting over 15,000 visitors in a month. Our partnership solidified with a contract designating me as the commercial sector representative. The first part of my strategy was coming together—I now had a powerful collection capable of being exported. The question remained: how?

I continued studying, improving my English, and found a Brazilian government program for exporting, offering free training. Simultaneously, I worked relentlessly to find works from previous collectors. In 2022, I found a collection in Rio de Janeiro at an incredible price.

In 2022, I continued handling sales to clients in Brazil, still without any sales from my collection. 

In April 2023, the first sale to a foreign customer emerged—a collector from Texas who discovered me through Twitter. This individual acquired one painting from the artist's collection and one from my collection (I will provide the values at the end). In my research, I found interesting marketplaces to list the artist's collection, with Saatchiart being the most suitable. It didn't take long, and in May, the first sale was completed to a customer in Denmark. However, we encountered a customs issue during the artwork shipment. I had to get in touch with the customer, leading to a better acquaintance. I introduced my collection, and the customer showed interest in two pieces, which I personally delivered to him in June.

Here are the values of the three paintings that I have sold so far: 

1. Painting 1 - Purchase price: 200 USD (1/10 of the Rio de Janeiro collector's collection) Selling price: 12,000 USD
2. Painting 2 - Purchase price: 720 USD (acquired from the artist with my commission during the São Paulo exhibition pre-sale) Selling price: 12,000 euros
3. Painting 3 - Purchase price: 2,100 USD (purchased from the artist in 2021) Selling price: 23,000 euros

Currently, I have 35 paintings in the club's collection, and the next steps include an exhibition in Rio de Janeiro in August/24 and the first European exhibition in 2025. I hope this story inspires you to invest in what you believe in.

If I could offer four tips to those reading:

1. Don't listen to friends and family when starting a new, unusual project. They won't understand until the first cent comes in, which may take years.
2. Study! Don't just go for shallow and superficial content; be curious.
3. Be resilient. It may sound cliché, but it's fundamental and real. I faced many difficulties until the first sale, over two years.
4. Be a diamond hand! Understand exactly how much your worth is and be willing to hold onto that value until the end. That's what will provide a foundation for your wealth.

I know that my sales are far below the values shown here, but I believe it's just the tip of the iceberg. This is not just a story about numbers but about believing.

🙏 Also credit to /u/ObservationalHumor for correcting some of what I wrote. I think I've seen your username somewhere before but I can't put my finger on it.

\-------

Let's dive into what I want to share. In 2020, the Fed started expanding its balance sheet from $4 trillion to $9 trillion. That's a lot of money. Let's examine how this money is sloshing around in our financial system.

1. First of all, when the Fed buys long-term bonds and puts them on its balance sheet, its taking those bonds off bank balance sheets and replacing them with bank reserves, while putting the bonds on its own balance sheet.
2. So a large chunk of QE money goes to increasing bank reserves
3. Bank reserve ratios go up, balance sheet costs go up, and banks try to shed bank reserves to earn a greater yield and reduce balance costs
4. They push a lot of money to money market funds (MMFs)
5. Interest rates start rising in March 2021 and US treasury isn't issuing as much short-term debt, MMFs default to Fed's Overnight Reverse Repo facility ON RRP for yield
6. ON RRP is an overnight loan and is a secure place to earn yield as interest rates go up. Since it resets every night, you don't miss out on higher interest rates by commiting as soon as possible
7. On the other hand, short-term debt like US tbills are bad investments when interest rates are rising as their values will fall. MMFs don't want to sell their assets at a loss from redemptions
8. So ON RRP balance starts rising to $2.4T from $0 in March 2021
9. Then, in June 2023, ON RRP balance starts falling and is now around $600 billion. That's almost a $2 trillion fall! What happened?
10. Debt ceiling lifted in 2023 and US Treasury starts issuing a ton of tbills. At the same time, Fed stopped raising interest rates and rates started plateauing across the rate curve.
11. MMFs start investing in tbills again and pull out money from the ON RRP to do that
12. This ON RRP money being used to buy tbills will run out eventually and there will be a smaller bid for treasuries at the Treasury auctions. At the same time, the Fed is running QT, reducing bank reserves
13. This will result in bank reserves dwindling a lot and threaten to drop the financial system out of what's known as the [""ample reserves"" regime](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/implementing-monetary-policy-in-an-ample-reserves-regime-the-basics-note-1-of-3-20200701.html)
14. This is why the Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan suggested that the Fed will need to slow down QT in March when the ON RRP balance drops to low levels

Hopefully this is a helpful explanation on how the QE money is sloshing around in our financial system. Comment any questions or corrections to what I posted.

Bitcoin is about to become a lot more valuable. The halving will reduce new supply, thus creating a form of scarcity. Which, in commodities, tends to drive price up. We also have a new way for retail investors to put their money into crypto. Which I think has the potential to raise the price just by more money being in that market. 

I don't particularly want to trade crypto, but I am interested in the stocks of companies mining it. With the halving, their mining operation will have its margins drastically reduced. Potentially becoming unprofitable. But it's stock of already Mined crypto will gain value. 

Do you think this is a time to invest in miners or short them? Recently they've taken a dive, but I don't know if that's a knee-jerk reaction to the news and hype. It could also be a time to get in on them at bargain prices.

However, I recently learned that IBKR has no reimbursement policy in case my account gets hacked.

Meanwhile, my accounts at Questrade guarantee a 100% reimbursement of direct losses if there is a hack: 

https://www.questrade.com/disclosure/privacy-policy-and-security/online-security-guarantee

I called IBKR and asked them if they have something similar. They called the Canadian office and then said they do not have such a policy in place. 

That changes everything. Even a 0.1% chance of getting hacked and losing money is not worth some commission savings. The very first rule with technology is that NOTHING is unhackable.

Investor protection funds (CIPF in Canada) only protect you if the broker goes bankrupt, NOT in any other circumstances. 

It is up to the broker to buy insurance to pay you out if they get hacked!

While the low borrowing costs at IBKR are nice, they are nothing that I can't emulate for even cheaper with box spreads.

I see this year as a year for tech to rise, not only because of the ai and tech advancement but also because people believe, and trust the tech companies too. MSFT, META, AMZN, are my top picks for this year, I can't see them go down, that is very unlikely, but they have a very good chance to flourish this year, however maybe not as much as last year due to their already high hype, but high hype doesn't always mean overvalued, look at apple in its past years, everybody buy apple phone but they think the stock was overvalued, but every year proved them wrong, it kept going up crazy strong. However there is NVDA which I really don't understand, I believe it is very overvalued but at the same time it is promising, however due to the overvalue I think it could get corrected and go down a bit, but idk, last week it got 12.5% up and that is simply fucking crazy, so I really can't understand how it works. is it safe to invest in NVDA? because I kinda feel like NVDA stock is risky, but i guess best choice is wait for a month and buy in a discount low if it actually get down, perhaps 10% lower would be good. am fairly new and interested to hear what you guys think about this year performance.

SUMMURY: I read the comments, so in total guys, make sure to do your research about CRWD and PANW, They seem the most promising. NVDA, MSFT, META, some people say they have had their run, so look at other stocks too not only those. search for BABA they might be very undervalued now. Also guys check AMZN, if you like MSFT then AMZN is probably a better investment, because AMZN is very strong, they have been investing in themselves that is why they were in negative revenue last two years, but some info seem to indicate they will finally flip the switch and start making revenue. which will drive the stock up this year."|0.61|11.0|0.0|11.0|['BABA', 'META', 'NVDA', 'CRWD', 'MSFT']

[https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html)

And they‘re now almost pricing in a 7th 0.25% rate cut by December – that would be one at every FOMC meeting from March to December.

There will be some rate cuts this year, as Powell already promised the markets, but I just don’t see 7 under a soft-landing scenario. Public comments from FOMC members also don’t indicate a willingness to cut that aggressively without a recession.

So what‘s the best risk-adjusted trade to make money in the event we get 3-4 cuts as expected (or something less than 7)? The FOMC dot plots predicted 0 cuts in 2023 &amp; ended up sticking to it – the markets got it wrong.

1) Of course, I could \*sell\* federal funds futures directly (buying = betting on lower rates), but they tie up capital (about $3,000 in maintenance per contract), and losses can be devastating in another SVB scenario or negative jobs/GDP report.

2) I could also short sell short-term treasury ETFs or bet on options on those ETFs, but treasuries aren’t perfectly correlated with federal funds rates.

Or is this idea assuming all money are established for retirement and thus equal pull-out weight?

It is neither *predictive* in what will happen next nor is it *prescriptive* in suggesting any course of investment actions. 

I've only done [3 predictive posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/s/pAtSiWhCXo) on this sub and this won't be one of them.

For those who are too young to remember that time:  There was this new thing called ""the Internet"", and it was going to forever change the world (it eventually did), and every company that hypes up some sort of ""internet tech"" (could be simple landing page that sells stuff, i.e Pets.com) received sky high valuation. 

And there was one company behind it that made it all possible: Cisco, the company that sells industrial routers and switches to telecom providers that power the backbone of the entire internet infrastructure, was *obviously* a company that was ""selling shovels during a gold rush"" and would take over the whole world. 

Its share price went up 236% from Jan.1999 to March 2000, reached a valuation of $500B+ (record high for a company back then), P/E went through the roof but it didn't matter because the *Internet Revolution^TM* was *just beginning* (and it was), so naturally Cisco's share price could only go higher.

The cherry on the top was that back then the **top two** companies were *Microsoft* and *Cisco*, one would provide the software (**Internet Explorer baby!**) and the other would sell the hardware. Together they would rule the world!

Now if you replace ""Internet"" with ""AI"", and ""Cisco"" with ""Nvidia"", keep Microsoft as it is (but replace ""IE"" with ChatGPT""), and we have quite a mirror version of what's happening today.

Then we all know what happened. Cisco obviously survived the bubble burst and remains profitable and is still doing fine today, but $CSCO *never* recovered back to its dotcom bubble peak after crashing 80% during the dotcom bust, 23 years later.

Now will the same thing happen with $NVDA? Like I said I don't know and I'm not making any predictions. All I can say is that I see a lot of parallels *so far*.

**Edit**: For people replying to me arguing how you can't mine Bitcoins using network switches or how Cisco didn't do AI, *no kidding*, at no point did I claim the two companies are identical and sell the same things, that would be idiotic.

The core business of Xerox, printing services and printers have been in a strong decline since covid, but the CEO claims that the revenue streams will be diversified and the “reinvention” of the company will be done in three years, at which point the company will be growing due to new revenue streams more than compensating for the decline of the old core business.

I had it specifically research the financials of stocks that I've manually been keeping up with and I was genuinely shocked at the accuracy and didn't realize how rapidly this was progressing. This is something that's accessible right now, but so were basic algorithmic trading systems in the early days if you had basic programming experience. I don't think this will remain the case in the future and the knowledge gap between your average trader and an institutional trader will be more pronounced than it already is. Trading systems will be able to factor in news sources, look across hundreds of different financials, C suite profiles, etc. and figure out what and what not to invest it and when to pull out. It will know when to ""buy the rumor"" and ""sell the news"". Private equity firms are already doing this in the private markets, it's something Blackstone has actively talked about.

From what I understand the end of the market cycle is characterized by the end of action - no more rate hikes. In all essence, provided we have no more rate hikes, we are at the end of the market cycle. 

&amp;#x200B;

From what I gather, and correct me if I'm wrong, the new market cycle begins with rate cuts. And almost always begins (or ends?) with a recession and sometimes downright economic collapse/stock market crash.

&amp;#x200B;

So the question is - does this have to be? This market cycle for lack of better words, was completely manipulated. The fed caused the entire market cycle. And the fed is going to cut rates not as reacting to something being severely broken, but because the rate hikes accomplished what they wanted the rate hikes to accomplish - tackling inflation. 

&amp;#x200B;

So will everyone stop saying ""late cycle economics"" or ""end of cycle market conditions"" once we have the fed pivot to lower interest rates? Or will they continue to say that the market cycle is still the same market cycle until we have a recession? 

  
If we have a soft landing, does this market cycle just go on and continue until something catastrophic happens? Does something catastrophic HAVE to happen, or do charts cause something catastrophic to happen - or what if we have no landing?

Option 2: Withdraw all, or a portion, and reinvest in more conservative stocks, such as low-cost index funds or something of that sort (we're not very knowledgeable on stock investments, other than the average). We are in our mid/late 30s for refence.

Option 3: Withdraw enough to pay off our mortgage, which would be around $780k at 2.90% on a 30 year fixed rate.

I have done some research and the main takeaway seems to be that because we have such a low interest rate we can go with Option 2 and get a higher return on our investment than paying off the mortgage and say reinvesting the $3500/month that would have been going towards the mortgage.

A bit more background. We already have a 6 months emergency fund and other misc. savings. We also don't have very much as far as debt. We do have a $850/month car payment, of which she receives $750/month towards it, from work. No credit card debt.

Will appreciate any advice or further questions I need to be asking ourselves. Thank you in advance.

P.s. Option 3, paying off our mortgage, seems very tempting to us. Just the idea of knowing we can be mortgage free in our mid 30s sounds very enticing.

Edit: Thank you all who gave their advice/opinion, really appreciate it! We are going to look into Option 2. This way we can create a bigger nest egg, remove the car payment (interest rate of around 7%) and bank the $750/monthly allowance, and reinvest a portion into more conservative stocks. Finally, we will be consulting with a financial advisor before making any actual moves. Once again, thank you all. "|0.75|57.0|0.0|57.0|[]
t3_192khh2|1704822061.0|investing|Reasons form capital gain distribution from an ETF|"I'm trying to understand what causes a capital gains distribution from an ETF.  
  
From the Vanguard website:  
  
""Although several factors can contribute to ETFs’ realization of capital gains, perhaps the most important is the consistent appreciation of an ETF’s holdings over an extended period. Global equities have generally enjoyed significant gains, with only brief interruptions, for more than a decade. As a result, many ETFs hold securities with unrealized capital gains that can become realized through the normal course of portfolio operations.""  
  
The situation that comes to mind is if at the time of share creation, the AP provided the ETF company with a collection of the underlying shares of stock. The AP then received ETF shares. The ETF company then sells the shares of the underlying stocks and receives current market value.  
  
A while later the AP wants to redeem their ETF shares. If the overall value of the underlying stocks are lower, then a gain is realized by the fund. Since it previously sold the shares at a higher price and is now giving them back (or cash value) to the AP at a lower price.  
  
Is anything approaching a correct understanding of what’s happening when an ETF has a capital gains distribution?

[https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Research/White-Papers/Driving-with-the-Rear-View-Mirror](https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Research/White-Papers/Driving-with-the-Rear-View-Mirror)

In this note, we decompose U.S. equity market excess-of-cash returns into four components—dividend yield, real earnings growth, multiple expansion, and the real return on cash—to analyze what assumptions investors need to have about the next ten years to expect a repeat of the past decade, or even historically average performance.

Conclusion  
Extrapolation is often imprudent, especially in  
financial markets where strong performance  
often tends to be associated with rich  
valuations. Stars must align in order to see  
an encore of last decade’s equity market  
performance—exceptional real earnings  
growth and all-time high valuations, with  
investors likely paying at least 80% more  
per dollar of earnings than at present. This  
proposition is even more dubious against  
the current backdrop of elevated macro  
uncertainty, persistent inflation, and  
contractionary monetary policy.  
Investors who are implicitly or explicitly  
relying on a repeat of the past decade or even  
on above-average equity market performance,  
such as those making reallocation decisions  
based on performance relative to equities,  
should take caution. The same is true even  
for investors who have reduced their equity  
allocations in favor of illiquid alternatives.  
Equity beta is ubiquitous and even illiquid  
assets such as private equity and private credit  
ultimately depend on the same drivers of  
returns—how much real cash flows will grow,  
and how much investors are willing to pay for  
cash flows.  
If we see a repeat of the past decade, hooray!  
In this scenario, there may be little harm  
in holding an allocation to lower beta and/  
or convex liquid alternatives, but also little  
benefit. If, however, equity performance  
is more in line with historical averages, or  
economic weakness and a return to more  
normal valuations cause equity markets  
to underperform, then truly diversifying  
alternatives are likely to be meaningfully more  
valuable to investors over the next decade."|0.58|2.0|0.0|2.0|['PDF']

Shares were down more than 8% in early hours trading by 5:05 a.m. ET.

  
The Federal Aviation Administration on Saturday said around 171 planes worldwide would be affected by its emergency airworthiness directive, which requires aircraft to be inspected before flying again. The order applies to U.S. airlines and carriers operating in U.S. territory.

  
It was issued after a piece of a plane blew out in the middle of an Alaska Airlines flight on Friday.

  
Images shared on social media showed a hole in the side of the aircraft and passengers using oxygen masks. The flight — Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 — returned to Portland shortly after departing for Ontario, California.

  
The National Transportation Safety Board has launched an investigation into the blowout.

  
“Safety will continue to drive our decision-making as we assist the NTSB’s investigation into Alaska Airlines Flight 1282,” FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said in a statement.

  
Of the 171 aircraft grounded under the directive, United Airlines has 79 and Alaska 65, while the remaining 74 are spread across six other airlines. The 178-seater aircraft that suffered a blowout on Friday was delivered to Alaska Airlines on Nov. 11th.

t3_191fsvn|1704699835.0|investing|What else should I do to diversify my portfolio?|"I would like some neutral advice on how to reach my financial goals. I'm curious what you would do in my position. This is a longer post but I'm just trying to paint a clear picture. Appreciate your time!

For starters, I do have some debts right now. About $10k in student loans, $15k in a personal loan, and $5k in credit card debt, I am confident I can manage these debts though. I'll have the cc paid off by March or April at the latest and have plans to finish the personal loan in 12-15 months, assuming nothing comes up. I'm leaving the student loans alone though

I've taken a step back career wise (tech sales) to try and start a government position soon. I'm confident I'll be starting a state position soon and will want to stay with the state to take advantage of the fantastic retirement benefits. I'm 34 now and would like to retire in my early 60s at the latest, 57 ideally, but wouldn't mind working until 62. My ideal retirement monthly income is in the $10-15k USD range.

So this is my current situation:

A) I have about $5-7k in my Roth right now. I withdrew a lot of it to buy my recent property (a condo). My goal is to increase this amount to $50k in the next 3-4 years. I believe, even if I stop contributing after the $50k point, it should grow into $90-140k by 50-60s. Obviously I want to do more but that's my short term plan for the Roth account.

B) According to my profile on the SSI website, I should expect my SSI payout to be in the $2k ish range, this is assuming I retire around 62 ish though. I conservatively entered my avg income as $80k for this calculation. I'm expecting my salary to be closer to the $100k range, assuming we're taking an average of all my working years. It doesn't make too much of a difference though

C) My retirement plan with the state should pay out in the $5-6k range, depending again on my retirement age and my avg salary within the state. I feel confident I'll have a monthly income of $4-5k through the CALPERs program but am aiming to land in the $6-7k range. I will also get health coverage after retirement.

D) I am taking a salary hit with this government position, looking at base salary alone and excluding benefits, I think my annual salary will be $75k ish. My goal is to grow into the $120-130k range and maintain it for at least 3 years. The state takes your highest salary from a 3 year range to calculate your pension.  I want to maintain an avg salary of $80k for SSI calculations though.

E) I am looking into a 457 account

This leaves me in the $7k ish range for salary, before taxes. That's $5k ish from my expected pension and $2k ish from SSI. My other issues are:

1. I have a child and want at least one more. I don't have anything saved for their college fund(s). I have an informal savings account with maybe $500 in it and that's it so far. She's only in the 4th grade so there will be a lot of continued expenses. I would really love to set both of them up with investment accounts. Something to help them with college, car, and/or home downpayment.
2. I have 3 mortgages currently. Even after rental income, due to PM fees, vacancies, etc. I'm negative $1-3k+ / year. Which honestly isn't bad since I've only been doing this &lt;5 years, but it ebbs my finances monthly, and affects how much my personal contributions are. By 57 these mortgages should be paid off, assuming I don't borrow towards them.
3. My salary for this year will likely be in the $70-80k range but I would like to have an average of $110k salary across a 3 year span between now and age 57 - to reach my CALPERs payout goal.
4. I am engaged and my fiance's salary should be more than mine ,but we're not sure because he's just finishing his graduate program. Because we're not sure where he's going to land, I'm being conservative and assuming his salary will be $80k/annual. His only debt right now are some student loans - maybe $50k ish total between undergrad and graduate school. He owns and rents out a tri-plex but I'm unsure of the exact numbers. He has maybe $30k in an investment account and $15k in stocks/crypto.I think it will be realistic to hit my future retirement salary goal but I don't feel confident I can save the $50k in time or get the child accounts set up either.

So basically my parents have 70-100k to
Invest in but they’re confused on what to do. They basically want passive income since in 10 years they’ll retire.

Some options include 

-Building a second unit to our house (our house is 1 story we would add another story and turn it into an apartment and rent it out ). It would cost around $250k and we would rent it for around $2500 per month, due to us living in an expensive area.

Pros- Increases house value, less risk and less loans

Cons- someone else will be living on our property


-Buying a vacation cabin in a small snowy town for around 400k and putting it on Airbnb. Or buying a house in a town that has a high occupancy rate on Airbnb. Mortgage would be around 1600 and they can make 3000 -5000 a month on Airbnb. Resulting in about 1200-3400 a month. 

Pros- We would have access to another property with land that is an investment and has long term benefits

Cons - it would be more risky


-another option would be to use this money to pay some of the mortgage on our house, so we would save money on interest.

One small cap, one mid-cap, one international (focusing on dividend yield), and one US (focusing on dividend yield).

I’m 50/M, live in the USA. No kids, divorced. Annual salary is $160k. Around $250k in a 401k and $450k in brokerage. About $200k in home equity and own a commercial property with about $400k equity that I’m currently trying to sell. My retirement date is 2032. I live in a VHCOL and am likely going to sell my house soon and move to a LCOL area. I work remotely for the most part but have occasional in office meetings. For those, I can easily travel to where my office is as the area where I’m thinking of moving to is only a few hours away by car. 

So if I sell my house and commercial property, that’ll be around $600k less fees. I could probably use a chunk of that to pay cash for a house-but I do have the V.A. Home loan and if I can get a low interest rate, maybe that makes more sense. So that’s a quick and dirty of my financial picture. I thought about buying a few apartments and renting them out.

My brokerage is through fidelity. It’s mostly spaxx right now with a little fzrox, fthix, and fsmax. Also have about $10k in a etf. Brokerage account is purely self directed right now.

Before starting, I'll just point out that most of my portfolio is index funds and ETFs. But I do have maybe 10-15% in single stocks, just to satisfy the inner (wannabe) Buffett.

So we've all heard the advice that diversification is important when building a portfolio. Correct me if wrong, but this can mean across different stocks, or by diversifying across assets, like stocks and real estate. 

I was looking for some online calculator that could find the correlation between two stocks and found this:

https://www.buyupside.com/calculators/stockcorrelationinput.php

It lets you put two stocks and the time period to calculate the correlation between. 

Could something like this be used just as a rudimentary tool. Either to see how whether you're actually as diversified as you think or to see you're not over concentrating in one area. Like investing in 5 different popular tech giants, which seems to be a thing some people do. 

However, some results I found were a bit strange so not sure if that means using figures like these are not so useful? Eg, apple and Goldman Sachs had a correction of 0.8585 over the past 5 years and 0.9058 over the last 10 years. Or Nvidia and PepsiCo also having a correlation just over 0.85. 

Are these figures just because stocks have generally all gone up over these time periods so the end result would be that mathematically they are correlated? Even though they are completely different industries/business models?

So can mathemical concepts/figures like these be useful, or do they not mean much since they are backwards looking, and it's better to diversify by knowledge of the different businesses. Such as, we might say intuitively that Apple and PepsiCo should be uncorrelated, no matter what price history suggests?

A final thought I'd like to hear opinions on, would be choosing from different industries based on the most diversification available. 

Eg, you pick Microsoft and apple in the tech sector (not in your portfolio, just as two options available) and PG and PEP in, not sure the exact industry name, but say consumer products? You've done whatever prior research you saw fit to arrive at these businesses and now want to narrow things down for whatever reason. 

And then have a 2*2 matrix with the different correlations between pairs. If there is a pair that might have significantly lower correlation than the other three, maybe you could pick that? Or is this still not very useful?"|0.6|1.0|0.0|1.0|['Microsoft', 'PepsiCo', 'Goldman Sachs', 'Apple']

t3_190y99s|1704650938.0|investing|The true interpretation of Friday's Jobs Report|"So Friday’s trading was based on the macro releases of the jobs report, and then the ISM services PMI data, which drove the price action in DXY and bond yields, which in turn drove movement in the equity market.  
So let’s first look at the elements of the jobs report as they came out:  
So the headline data came out at 216k, vs 170k consensus, and prior month of 177k, which was revised down from 199k.  
The unemployment rate was stable at 3.7% against last month, below expectations of a tick up to 3.8%  
Average Hourly YOY came in at 4.1% vs 3.9% forecast, and previous reading of 4%  
Now on the surface, these numbers look hot. Headline employment came out hotter, unemployment rate came out softer, and the hourly YOY came out higher than expected. One would, at first, think that this would point to rates staying higher for longer than the market is currently anticipating (which is the first rate cut to come in march).  
This is what drove the initial price movement in DXY and Bond yields. We must note that this first reaction is almost always the result of algos trading. Institutions set trading parameters before key data comes out, such as that if headline employment comes out higher than expected, go long dollar, or go short treasuries on the expectation that this algorithmic trading would allow them to be early to the news.This is why USD and bond yields shot up at first. Since these are algorithms trading, we cannot take the initial price movement to be indicative of the true, rational reaction to the data, which we came to see as markets reversed both these moves shortly after.  
What then, can we make of this jobs report, when we look under the hood a little, and why did USD fall, and equities rise, on what appears to be a hot report?  
Well, to answer this, we need a bit of context. Firstly, this was a December report. December tends to be a hot month for the jobs market, as we see seasonal hiring. As such, December reports should be taken with a grain of salt when assessing any deviation from the existing trend.  
Furthermore, we need to look at the revision to previous data, which is key to analysing this report.Last months report got revised down from 199k headline to 173k, a reduction of 26k in December alone. Across both November and October, net revisions were down 71k.As such, we need to look at the totality of the data.December’s payroll numbers came hot by 46k, but the net revision downwards for previous months was -71k.As such, the hot headline number for December was taken to be more or less in line, when you consider the downward revision to previous months.  
Furthermore, we must recognise that whilst December’s headline number did come hot, it was not so hot as to disrupt the clear trend of the 3 month moving average in employment numbers. We can see from the chart below that looking at the 3 month moving average, which negates month to month variation, we can still clearly see a downward trend in employment, in line with what the Fed wants to see.  
[https://imgur.com/a/F5gbPcb](https://imgur.com/a/F5gbPcb)    
Further reinforcing this, Fitch themselves noted that the job growth over the last 3 months is now 165k, just in line with the 2019 average of 164k. So removing month to month variation, the jobs numbers are now normalising back to pre covid levels.  
After the jobs report, we had the ISM service numbers too.  
Here, we saw services PMI come out at 50.6, below forecast of 52.6, but still expansionary. Importantly, we saw the Services employment numbers come out at 43.3, vs prior numbers of 50.7. Service employment is therefore in contraction, for the first time since June.  
This is another indicator of the jobs market continuing to cool, despite a hot headline number on the non farm report.  
In fact, the fact that services PMI still came out expansionary could fuel the goldilocks scenario crucial to the soft landing narrative, which is why the market initially reacted positively.  
In fact, we can see clearly what I am saying by looking at the price action, with time stamps for when the various data points were released.  
Look at the movement of the 10 year yields, intraday  
[https://imgur.com/a/7jHnbsV](https://imgur.com/a/7jHnbsV)    
We got that early spike when the jobs report came out, the result of algorithmic trading. It then cooled off as human traders began to take the point about the revisions to previous months into account. We then saw a big sell off in yields and USD when ISM data came out, pointing to further weakness in services employment.  
This explains why the equity market moved up to 4720, as the dollar and bond yields sold off.  
It also explains why the pricing of March rate cuts initially fell to 50%, due to the result of algorithmic trading on USD and bonds, but then increased again back to where it was more or less before the data, as humans looked to interpret the revisions to previous data as not so bad.  
Yes, we saw some paring of these gains. This was as USD pared some of its early losses. This makes sense to me. I mean, the jobs report, whilst not bad per say, was not good. It didn’t really warrant  a move up in equity prices.  
The fact that the market closed flat on the day is more or less where I see the jobs report. It wasn’t as bad as traders initially feared, nor was it good enough to warrant a move higher. It was more or less okay. It maintains the 3 month moving average trend, and didn’t do much to change it.This is why DXY and SPX and Treasury yields closed the day more or less flat.  
We could see from option data on VIX that before the data that options traders were selling calls. This was why VIX got crushed, which helped the market to not sell off on the data.  
So where does that leave us? Pretty much unchanged I’d say. A quick look at the skew data on various indices, shows that skew is still moving to the downside.  
We can look at MSFT as a gage too, since it leads nasdaq. We can see that the skew is still driving downward pressure, but block trades are slightly up.  This tells us we can continue to expect more volatility in the short term, likely continuing a move lower. The main options trades are selling calls so that would make sense. But the money flows increasing tells us that probably can see some buying of the dip in the medium term, which will move things higher again. Again, this is just from the options data, which changes often so will keep you guys updated on this.

* It would have a total value of about 35% of my non-house/non-auto assets, which are almost entirely equities.

t3_190jmn7|1704601796.0|investing|Dallas Fed Pres Logan said Fed might need to slow balance sheet run-off (QT) soon. Here's exactly why.|"Dallas Fed Pres Logan said that if the ON RRP (overnight reverse repo) balance fell low enough, the Fed might need to intervene to slow its balance sheet run-off (aka slow quantitative tightening).

# Context

First of all, let's go over what ON RRP means.

ON RRP is a Fed facility that allows financial institutions to park excess cash with the Fed, loan the Fed this cash overnight and the Fed will pay the institutions 24 hours an interest + principle.

Interest paid is annualized 5% (or whatever the prevailing Fed Funds Rate is).

When the Fed started raising interest rates, ON RRP balance soared from $0 to $2T. This is because the Fed Funds Rate was high enough that ON RRP made sense.

Starting early last year, the ON RRP balance has started to fall precipitously.

The running theory is that this balance is used to buy short-term t bills rather than keeping it in ON RRP. US treasury issued a LOT of t bills after debt ceiling lifted.

# Why slow QT?

One interpretation of ON RRP falling is that this money is going into the financial system, which increases liquidity.

Slowing QT as a response then seems counterintuitive, seems slowing QT increases liquidity too.

So why would the Fed slow QT as a response of the ON RRP falling?

The reason is that the ON RRP is falling bc money market funds are buying US t bills instead. The US Treasury issued a LOT of t bills last year when the debt ceiling lifted.

If the ON RRP is depleted, that means there is a lack of a bid for t bills, and can cause volatility in short-term interest rates.

Not good!

By slowing QT, the Fed can then step in to put a bid on t bills to stabilize short-term interest rates.

# This greatly increases liquidity, what about inflation?

Yes, letting ON RRP balance fall off, and then slowing QT greatly increases liquidity. That's why Dallas Fed pres Logan said the Fed could raise the Fed Funds Rate a little bit higher to keep inflation in check.

Average global sea temperatures would peak at around 21.2°C this spring.  These readings would be so high they would be off the chart of the graph linked below.

* [Charles Schwab](https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/2024-global-outlook-big-picture)

I reviewed the 2024 market outlooks of JP Morgan, BlackRock, Citi, Mastercard, and Charles Schwab. This is a summary of their overarching themes.

# Themes

**💡Inflation and interest rates will fall**

The five firms agree that inflation will continue to fall throughout 2024, giving central banks room to cut interest rates.

Even JP Morgan, the only firm that published a bearish outlook, predicts US inflation will drop to 2.1% with the Fed starting to cut interest rates in the third quarter.

It’s important to keep in mind that the past three recessions started right after the Fed started cutting interest rates. Expect the market to be more antsy as we near the first rate cut later this year.

**💡CapEx returns**

Last year, companies (and pretty much everyone else in the economy) were nervous about an impending economic slowdown and companies cut back on spending.

With economic angst subsiding this year, CapEx is expected to bounce back.

More CapEx means higher revenues and faster growth. This is ultimately good for stock prices.

**💡US election year**

Fed unlikely to do drastic policy changes this year, don't want to stir the pot during election.

Less policy volatility is good for markets.

Largely a nothing burger. If Dems win, business-as-usual. If Reps win, market won't be disappointed since Reps are considered market-friendly. A Rep win is bad for war stocks though.

**💡First half angst, second half gains**

Citi predicts that economic growth will be slow in the first half of 2024 before accelerating in the second half. They don’t see a recession happening.

BlackRock also sees the economy slowly recovering this year in a “U-shaped” fashion.

Tom Lee also thinks it'd be a ""slow then grow"" year. He predicts that the S&amp;P 500 will be flat or down 5% in the first half of the year before rallying to 5,200 by year-end.

**💡Everyone is bullish on AI**

The Mag 7 is a good way to get AI exposure, as are chip designers like Nvidia and AMD. Citi is particularly bullish on chip manufacturers given their relative under-performance last year (e.g. TSMC).

In addition, Citi believes that AI has the most potential to uplift these industry segments:

* Mag 7 (mega cap tech)
* Infrastructure (chipmakers, semiconductor equipment, data centers)
* Robotics
* Drug discovery
* Cybersecurity

**💡International: Japan, China, and India**

For international markets, the five firms are generally bullish on Japan, China, and India while being lukewarm on Europe.

The high level bull case for Japan is that the BOJ will finally have to seriously raise interest rates this year. This will lead to a stronger yen, attract more foreign investment into the Japanese economy, and ultimately drive up the dollar value of Japanese tech and finance stocks.

Cool point from Charles Schwab on the power of Japan in global finance:

&gt;Moves by the Bank Of Japan (BOJ) could overshadow those by the Federal Reserve and other central banks if Japanese investors begin to sell foreign bonds, stocks, and currencies. Decades of current account surpluses have accumulated, giving Japan the world's largest net international investment position (even more than China) with $3.3 trillion of investments held abroad according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Although the U.S. has the largest economic influence in the world, Japan may have the largest influence in the asset markets due to these account surpluses. Should the BOJ begin to substantially tighten monetary policy next year, as signaled by the end of yield curve control at the BOJ's meeting in October, the potential for a reversal of decades of outward flow of capital may be felt by investors worldwide. With rates rising in Japan contrasting with rate cuts elsewhere, the yen could surge along with Japanese bond yields, prompting Japanese investors to bring their money home and invest in Japanese assets.

# Risks

**💡Economic risks**

Interest rates and inflation are top of mind.

The general worry is that we haven’t felt the full negative effects of 2021-2022’s large interest rate hikes (perhaps they surface this year?) AND there’s a high chance we’re entering into a high interest rate and high inflation economic environment.

**💡Geopolitical Risks**

Every firm warned about geopolitical risks in 2024, from the ongoing wars in Eastern Europe and the Middle East to tensions in the South China Sea. A couple firms recommended defense and energy stocks as a hedge against these risks.

My contrarian opinion is that 2024 is a year of geopolitical normalization with the major geopolitical hot spots of yesteryear cooling down.

The Red Sea shipping crisis is an annoying thorn on the side of the global supply chain but it seems to be causing limited damage, for now.

Not sure what China will do if Taiwan's 1/13 elections don't play out in their favor. Probably nothing serious as they've always done before.

# Summary

With the exception of JP Morgan, everyone else seems to align on a general theme of “economic normalization to growth” for 2024. Citi sees the US economy going through three major phases from the start of the pandemic:

* 2020-2021: emergency low rates and quantitative easing to stimulate the economy
* 2022-2023: bear market caution as a result of rapid interest rate hikes and quantitative tightening
* 2024-2025: normalization to growth

We agree with this prediction and see more upside for US stocks in 2024. Last year, the S&amp;P 500 almost returned to all-time-highs despite having to climb a wall of worry from a myriad of economic and geopolitical risks. This year, many of those risks are subsiding, opening the way for stocks to go higher."|0.88|97.0|0.0|97.0|['BOJ', 'Nvidia', 'AMD', 'the International Monetary Fund', 'Fed', 'the Federal Reserve', 'BlackRock, Citi,', 'Morgan](https://www.jpmorgan.com', 'AI', 'Mag 7', 'JP Morgan', 'TSMC', 'the Bank Of Japan', 'BlackRock']

2. Contributed about 22k in total to my TSP and 403b combined, both being traditional/pretax money



This should end up with a taxable amount of about 50-22=28k in the federal 12% tax bracket. Since the federal tax bracket goes up to $44,725, I am thinking to roll over 44,725-28,000=$16,725.  
  
  
  
My questions are as follows:  


1. Is this a smart idea? I personally feel 12% is a low and great tax bracket to do this, regardless of which side you fall on in the debate of whether tax brackets will increase or decrease in the long run. Seeking advice because I'm unsure if I'm thinking too simple-minded.
2. Is there any advice on which account I should roll the money out of? I hear that TSP has better expense ratios than the other choices because it's gov, so I'm unsure if I should keep my money in there.
3. I understand this is more of a tax question, but my income this year was split between California and New York. Will the amount of money I roll over, and therefore the tax I pay, follow my current address?  

4. Following the above, are there extra numbers I should look at to avoid paying extra in taxes based on my current address? For example, I am in NYC now.

Should I be comfortable with 10k in standard savings and just start putting all of my money in vanguard? I don’t love the idea of maxing out my Roth IRA like a lot of people tell me. I like the idea of having more money in a brokerage so I can move it easier as my life changes. Also are there investments that better suit me that I’m not taking advantage of?
 
I know there’s no real answer as it’s person to person but do you guys still contribute regularly to a standard savings account? I can’t think of a situation in my current life that would require more than what I have outside of vanguard. If I’m thinking about buying a house down the line can I just liquidate my investments?"|0.58|2.0|0.0|2.0|['etfs']

So as far as I know buying a call option offers the investor the _option_ of buying 100 shares of an equity at a pre-determined price.

For example let’s say I want to buy a call option of SPY with expiration December 24, I predict that SPY is going to go up by let’s say 6% so I will buy the call option at market price + 6% - call option cost (I don’t know how the call option cost is calculated so if you could explain that it would be really helpful).

Given the current market situation SPY is at $ 467.92, let’s round it to $ 468 and let’s put a call option cost of 100, then $ 468 + 6% = $ 496.08.

Now I have some questions:
- how should I in this case take into account the call option cost?
- if I understand correctly and the option expires profitable I would get a 6% - call option cost for each of the 100 shares in the contract leading to an xx% gain?
- in this case isn’t it almost always profitable to trade options long term in broad market etfs? (well at least if you predict the market is going to have a positive return)."|0.6|1.0|0.0|1.0|['SPY']

The reason is simple and can be seen in companies that have both voting and non-voting shares outstanding.

I've been watching Mad Money and Cramer has been saying ""you should take some gains cause the big money won't start buying mag 7 till they sell off more""

I think that's true.

I.made really good gains in nvda. I bought in at $144 a year and a half ago and I'm up to $490 a share, but it's been topping at $495 or so and then staying in range.

t3_18zn1cq|1704502565.0|investing|Technical Analysis: The Bullish Case for MRNA’s Inverted Scallop|"While market movements often appear chaotic, observant analysts can decipher patterns hinting at investor sentiment and future trajectories. One such narrative is unfolding in Moderna Inc. (MRNA), where a curious pattern emerged in October 2023 – the inverted scallop.Though not widely known, renowned candle expert Thomas Bulkowski identifies the inverted scallop as a significant bullish reversal indicator. This J-shaped pattern, mirroring MRNA's price action since October, suggests a potential shift in momentum after a prolonged downtrend that saw the stock plummet from $456.76 to $71.23. Interestingly, Bulkowski showcased a strikingly similar pattern in Boeing's 2005 price action, adding weight to the potential for a bullish reversal in MRNA.

**Technical Allies Confirm the Narrative:** While the inverted scallop itself is compelling, additional technical indicators solidify the bullish thesis:

**Divergence:** MRNA's recent price action exhibits bullish divergence, where the price hits lower lows while an oscillator forms higher lows, indicating weakening downside momentum.

**Chaikin Money Flow (CMF):** Positive CMF values during the scallop formation signify buying pressure and accumulation, further bolstering the bullish outlook. MRNA's recent CMF readings align with this notion.

**Resistance Breakouts:** Notably, MRNA has already breached the crucial resistance zones around $86.02-$87.11, $89.90, and $97.28, solidifying the pattern's confirmation and adding fuel to the bullish fire.

**Market Psychology**: Reading Between the Lines:The emergence of the inverted scallop following a prolonged downtrend reflects a shift in market psychology. Initially driven by fear, the potential reversal suggests a growing sense of optimism. Investors may be starting to recognize MRNA's intrinsic value and anticipate a brighter future, particularly in light of promising developments like their success in phase 3 studies for various infectious diseases and personalized cancer vaccines.

**A New Chapter for MRNA?:** With its price action painting a picture of recovery and technical indicators flashing green, the inverted scallop pattern offers a captivating glimpse into what could be a sustained bullish resurgence for MRNA. Backed by supportive technicals and a shift in market sentiment, the narrative hints that MRNA may be on the verge of writing a new chapter in its story.

This week was my turn to cash them in with a plan to convert them into a 12 month CD before using the money in 2025 for what it has been earmarked.

I withdrew all 10820 dollars and three days later only about 7000 showed up in my bank account. No notice, no explanation. 10k left and only 7k arrived. I was confused and annoyed. So I started digging - the first clue was the transaction was initiated by the treasury offset program - an entity that I was unaware of until two days ago, and where state and federal debt gets reported, and which has the power to service those debts with funds that you have with the government (such as I bonds, apparently). 

So I called them and they informed me that I had debt in a state that I have not lived in for nearly a decade. I followed the trail with my next call being to that state’s treasury, which referred me to the motor vehicle department where this debt had been initially reported. It turns out that the DMV in this state has falsely assessed that from 2016-2017 I did not have insurance on a car that I have long since sold. The car was not even being driven in that state in 2016 anymore, but that didn’t keep them from slapping me with a $3k fine, 7 years later, and collect said fine from my iBond transfer.

I couldn’t remember which insurance company I used for this car back then, so I’ve been on endless hold/phone loops with all previous insurance companies who have to go digging in their archives for my old policies. 

Ultimately, I think I can get my money back, but I will certainly loose out on some interest, and a whole lot of time. 

I don’t know if there is a lesson here for others - the State DMV told me that they tried to reach me but can’t provide proof of that. I got no answer to why this debt was assessed now and didn’t come up when I filed for taxes the last 7 years (which they can do, too, apparently). I’ve never had a worse customer service experience than with the US government.

I guess make sure you don’t have state or federal debts that might get your iBonds garnished when you try to withdraw them. 🤷‍♂️🤣

So if a person has an annual income of less than 86k any capital gains they have is taxed at 0%. 

My question is, do the gains count toward income?

Let’s say they didn’t. 

Wouldn’t it make sense to not contribute to a 401k since gains in a 401k would be taxed as income at your future income tax bracket?

You could plow that money into a brokerage, with after tax money, and never pay a dime in taxes with you aren’t making an income in retirement, since capital gains are 0% with less than 86k income.

1. **Clinical Studies and Pipeline**: Rezolute is progressing with significant clinical studies. They have initiated a Phase 3 clinical study for RZ358 to treat congenital hyperinsulinism and are expected to complete enrollment by the end of 2024, with topline results anticipated in mid-2025. Additionally, they have completed the enrollment for their Phase 2 study in Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) with RZ402. 

2. **Financial Health**: As of the first quarter of fiscal 2024, Rezolute reported having $106.9 million in cash, cash equivalents, and investments in marketable debt securities. This is a strong cash position that supports their ongoing clinical programs. [Source](https://www.stocktitan.net/news/RZLT/rezolute-reports-first-quarter-fiscal-2024-wvy2o4hvbsg3.html)

3. **Analyst Ratings and Stock Performance**: Analysts have given RZLT stock a ""Strong Buy"" rating, with a 12-month forecast price of $10.75, indicating a significant upside potential from its current price. This represents an increase of 998.40% from the latest price [Source](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/rzlt/). Another source mentions a price target of $9.67 [source](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-RZLT/forecast/) 

4. **PRIME Eligibility**: The company has received PRIME eligibility from the European Medicines Agency for RZ358 in congenital hyperinsulinism, which is a positive recognition for their novel therapies ([source](https://www.stocktitan.net/news/RZLT/rezolute-reports-first-quarter-fiscal-2024-wvy2o4hvbsg3.html)).

5. **Investor Base and Market Capitalization**: The company's strong investor base is tightly holding the stock, resulting in low liquidity. However, the specific details about the investor base were not covered in the sources.

6. **Overall Market Position**: Rezolute's focus on rare diseases and their advancing clinical pipeline positions them interestingly in the biotech sector, especially considering their current valuation relative to their cash holdings.

Anyone have any investing advice to suggest further action in investing into $RZLT regarding recent stock behavior? It seems like the stock is trading way less than comps at 30 million market cap, which is 1/3 of its cash value. Strong investor base that is tightly holding the stock, so there is low liquidity.

I've been looking into adding SCHD within my Roth for dividends and had some questions about whether it would be a good option.   


Below are a few comments I saw made by others and wanted additional opinions.  


* It would be more beneficial to remain with VTI due to being a growth ETF and its ability to out-perform SCHD.
* Dividends are not free money, they come at the expense of growth. When a fund issues a dividend, the NAV/price of the fund decreases to compensate. Assuming you reinvest dividends, you just end up with more share that are worth less.
* Stay the course of Growth and when in/near retirement, sell and buy SCHD or dividend focused portfolio to live off dividends.

t3_18yq88d|1704407862.0|investing|Down payment vs ETF investment|"So I’ve been pondering my head for more than a week and decided to get some other perspective and outside look from here. Bit of background - EU based, 26yo, 3yrs in the finance career world, engaged and we are doing relatively well compared to average standard in terms of earning and way of living

With that in mind, we have managed to save a significant portion of cash, say 10-15% of a median house value, since we graduated that is currently not earning us anything, which is my first pondering point or perhaps regret. My internal justification is that in the short term we would like to buy a place we call home, thus any market investments might hurt this plan, except perhaps 6m-1y government bonds. But now I am also learning that LTV on mortgages can go up to 100%, meaning that besides the fees around the transaction, assume max 5% of the house value, rest of my savings can potentially be in ETF, which assuming the time in the market statement, should be a better investment in the long term than having a lower loan, right ? After my money compounding at 10-15% rates would be better than 5-7% rate I would be paying for my mortgage

So perhaps part of my question within my head is have I been leaving money on the table the past three years by not being invested (likely yes) or should I commit to time in the market and fully utilize lenders ?

For example, taking out a 2-3X leverage loan on a simple ETF like VOO or QQQ or holding futures like MES would not have that issue. (Is there a global version of MES available to retail investors?) Of course loans have an interest rate, but assume that one things long-term market growth outweighs that. What do you think of this simpler long-term, leverage strategy?

t3_18xwrtm|1704322450.0|investing|What if you need a Financial Advisor?|"I have seen many people ask questions about financial advisors. Most times the overwhelming advice given here is to do it on your own. I don’t like this advice.

While there are many people who can do it on their own, the vast majority of people live busy lives, and would prefer help. When they come here asking for help, we should point them in a good direction so they don’t end up paying a 5.75% load, or worse, Whole Life Insurance.

Here is what I recommend for someone who wants a Financial Advisor. 

$3,000-$49,999: Vanguard Digital Advisor. You will pay 0.15% in advisory fees/year. You can set your financial goals and Vanguard will manage the portfolio for you. It’s all done via computer and this is 1 step up from doing it yourself.

$50,000-$499,999: Vanguard Personal Advisor: Cost is 0.30% in advisory fees/year. You can call or have a video call with an advisor that will help you establish goals, do asset allocation, plan withdraw strategies, etc. This is the lowest cost reputable advisory platform I know of today. 

$500,000+: Vanguard Personal Advisor Select: same cost as above, but with this amount of assets you will get a personal CFP that will help you plan for everything and manage your portfolio for you. 

To conclude, if you want to do it yourself, go for it. But for those who feel they need help, this is the best platform that I am currently aware of. 

If anyone knows of any other good advisory platforms, I hope you share."|0.33|0.0|0.0|0.0|['Whole Life Insurance', 'Vanguard Digital Advisor', 'CFP', 'Vanguard']

t3_18xo94r|1704301967.0|investing|Possible opportunity of a lifetime that I'd like an opinion on.|"hi 24M living in the US working at a typical corporate job, kind of doing the classic stuff of saving my money/investing in retirement accounts/living somewhat below my means and I think overall I'm doing okay and am happy with my progress. Around mid last year, my grandfather died and my mother along with her 2 siblings has inherited his assets of around 20 hectares of land in the Philippines. Over my winter break, I learned about this and what they planned on doing with the land, which they explained they wanted to start a business with it as a quarry and contract soil to sell to companies that want it.( i literally dont even know what this means ) My parents think that the business will be super profitable and may give us the money to have my mother quit her job and live a comfortable life overseeing the business. Apparently this has been an ongoing process and my mother has already put in around 11k to assist with starting this up, but they explained that with the lawyer they are in contact with, they would need around 2.5m philippine pesos in order to transfer ownership of the land officially, pay the tax on the land, and whatever else needs to be done, and once those intial costs have been covered the quarry can start. 

The thing is, my parents want to start this process now and is urging me to give them the money (2.5m phil pesos = $50,000) to start this and that once the quarry starts, the first thing to be paid off is the money that's owed, which will be me plus even more money on top. My main concern is that I don't even have the money to give them BUT unlike my parents I CAN have the funds to give them. My credit is great unlike theirs and I've been looking up personal loans. Now before everyone freaks out, here is my money breakdown:

Monthly: $4200

Expenses: $1600

HYSA:17k

I have to say I am living comfortably at my parents house, once again saving money and whatnot which is why I'm so skeptical about all this. My plan is to put 15k of my HYSA and pull out a personal loan of 35k to fund this. Im confident I can make the monthly payments but it would absolutely smash my savings rate that I've been doing so well on.

It's really important to state that my family is not rich by any means and we do not have the money to fund this, I've already awknowledged this is an extremely risky thing but I must say, I live in an asian household so I absolutely love my parents and want the best for them. This post isn't some post saying my parents are nagging me for money. I love and trust them and want the best for them and am seriously considering this but i've awknowledged that pulling out this loan and having the quarry fail could basically ruin my life for the next couple years but haviing the quarry be successful would be absolutely great for jsut my family in general...and now this is the important part

My whole shpiel about this is that I have no idea what my money is going into. Ever since I've taken a minimalistic approach to life, the things I like to put my money towards has to have a reason that I myself am super familiar with. Typically I do countless hours of research about some investment method so that I know what I'm getting myself into, but in this situation I feel like I'm throwing my money at the void hoping itll make a lot of money with no way of doing any kind of research. So I know the general timeline of what they want to get done. But i don't know who the lawyer is, how my money will be broken down, how the business will work, man I dont even know what a quarry IS. So i'm hoping this post will give me some light into what I'm getting to. What exactly is a quarry and how does it work? What kind of costs are associated with starting a quarry in the Philippines? I'm imagining the money doesn't just go straight to my bank account when I get paid since this is a foreign business?  Does any profit thats given to us once it's started have to be taxed in the US AND PH? Is 20 hectares of a soil quarry over time really a profitable business? SHOULD I EVEN BE PUTTING MYSELF IN 35K DEBT TO FUND THIS given my situation??? I'm super skeptical if this will actually be a means to make a life-changing amount of money. And if there are any kind of answers or input you guys can give I would greatly appreciate it. I would also appreciate any kind of questions I could ask my parents or maybe some links/articles I could read up on to fully understand whats going on."|0.67|34.0|0.0|34.0|[]

t3_18xjty6|1704289784.0|investing|Why do many people chase the wrong things?|"One thing I never figured out in my short 38 years on this planet is why people chase the wrong thing, and think math is the rule of life when logic and sound judgement and living within your means should be more of a priority?

&amp;#x200B;

Many people say paying your house off aggressively and paying a 3.8% mortgage off as fast as possible, and paying car loans off as fast as you can - are bad ideas. The usual excuse is that math doesn't lie, or the market returns better and you're throwing your money away paying a mortgage off.

&amp;#x200B;

But then you have bear markets, like 2008, 2022, and what it looks  like 2024 may shape up to be like. People chase things like Bitcoin thinking it's going to make them rich, many people say Financial Advisors are a waste of money as you should just invest in a S&amp;P 500 index fund and forget it, and I get that. But if we do have a huge crash this year when the fed pivots, we're going to be in dire straights as a society.

&amp;#x200B;

Many people are probably going to end up upside down in mortgages, many people can't refinance their way to ""having another $100 to invest"" when rates are 4x what they were 3 years ago thanks to the Federal Reserve. And what's really ironic is times like these are what creates people.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't tell you how many people I hear complain about inflation, how things are so expensive, yet they have not put 1 penny extra over their monthly payment to try to get rid of their house payment. Yet if you did, you now have so much extra cash flow it's insane. You have options to invest you would have never had before, and inflation it actually helps you because it drives up your asset values while you just sit back and... so what... groceries are like 1/10th of what you are putting into CDs and Treasuries right now on a monthly basis. Who cares?

&amp;#x200B;

And the other thing many don't think about - housing payments make up 60% of expenses most people have after they retire. If you get rid of that housing payment, then you literally just more than doubled the size of your 401K nest egg. And not only that, my parents who subscribe to the same pay your house off early stance are now almost 10 years into retirement and they haven't even had to take anything out of their 401K yet because Social Security is literally covering all their groceries/utility bills. They can use their entire 401K for luxury things like new cars ""just because they want"", travel, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

People don't think of this. They just think ""oh you're missing out on returns"" and don't realize cash flow is a huge thing when you retire. HUGE."|0.26|0.0|0.0|0.0|['Social Security', 'fed', 'the Federal Reserve', 'Financial Advisors']

b) how do the funds reinvest those coupons - do they automatically buy more of the same underlying security for the fund?
c) does it really matter what the returns from a NAV perspective are at any point in time? ultimately shouldnt investors focus on YTM as their return benchmark?
d) why would returns significantly underperform YTM - i understand things may not be held until maturity but isnt the idea to get high coupon payments over life of fund?

t3_18wk2d3|1704182012.0|investing|Crazy investment nightmare|"Dumbest investment banking story to me was recently. I had been waiting almost a year for previous employer to finalize year end transactions for 401K account so I could rollover to an IRA. 

I decided to try out investing there at the same firm. Things seemed easy and legit at first. Filed paperwork via Docusign. Received email confirmation of receipt and email from the sender that all was good. Got multiple phone messages to contact them claiming there was an issue with my address. So I returned the call to be informed my address cannot be accepted from and FDIC insured facility. Gee that’s funny it’s my address and my current two financial institutions have no issues and are FDIC insured. The legit argue transfer me to three supervisors. They claim the IRS defuses to recognize the address. Gee that’s funny I’ve received official mail there from IRS, Department of state and Department of Homeland Security with no issues. In fact recently even had my passport updated with this address. They insist no no no it’s not possible and they won’t open the account with this address. I give them a business address and they argue about it but finally say ok. 

So after ten days I inquire about the rollover. Am informed that they won’t accept fund from the 401K institution. Ummm it’s in your institution’s care. Why can’t you accept funds from your own institution?  They never clarified that and went back to my address is invalid. So I say fine forget it just send me a cashiers check and I’ll open an investment account elsewhere. 

I get transferred to some other department and am told that I never submitted any paperwork and have to start over. So I hang up and contact previous employer. They’ve not received any paperwork either. So I call back the financial institution. Get paperwork sent over to me again even though I have the emails from docusign and from previous employee. They say no that’s of no use. Fill out paperwork with the new account info where I opened the new account and want fund sent. I send to former employer, third party administrator and to the supervisor. Am assured all in order and it should be less than five days. Again 10 days go by. I get message that my account was successfully funded. Go check and opening balance is same as when I set it up. So inquiring about any pending transaction and told no nothing yet. Call previous institution that told me they cannot accept funds from themselves to be told they opened the initial account that according to them couldn’t be opened, funded and that I had never sent in paperwork. So I asked how any of this was possibly. They stated well you signed the documents. Ok but you told me eighty-three times they didn’t exist. I say I’m no longer confident that they should handle my investments and wish to close the accounts and transfer funds to another firm. They tell me I cannot do that that I can only receive a cashiers check and now I will be taxed the full amount as I’m withdrawing prior to age 60. I explain I don’t wish to withdraw only to transfer funds and then close s the account as this firm has lied, been a nightmare and that no one there has any competence. The supervisor admits that I requested the cashiers check prior to the account being opened and that she told me they wouldn’t accept the funds even if f they were sent yet they did and so it goes. I filed a claim with the state securities fraud division with only a response that they’ve received the claim and no action is to be taken."|0.27|0.0|0.0|0.0|['IRS', 'FDIC', 'Department of Homeland Security', 'Department of state and']
t3_18wjuwx|1704181205.0|investing|Using 401k as short term investment for real estate retirement plan starting in 5 years?|"Edit: I don’t have good comment karma yet so unfortunately I can’t reply to the comments below, so I’m sending some of you guys messages to talk about your comments further. And I also want to reiterate that my plan is to be self employed in 5 years or so. I will be trading FOREX/stocks as my income. Real estate will be part of my retirement plan instead of a 401k. When I become self employed I won’t have an employer to match my 401k contributions. And also by the time I’m “retirement age” my tax bracket will be higher than the one I’m in now. So I don’t really see much of a benefit of a 401k for the long term given my plans and situation. And I also want to mention that I have a pretty decent amount of savings from previous investments that were high risk high reward that paid off pretty nicely.

Hi everyone. I was sitting here thinking. Let me know your thoughts. So for a little backstory i'm 29 years old and gross about $40,000 a year from my job. Currently single with no kids. Not many expenses. Very little debt. I own my home. So besides some basic living expenses and helping family members occasionally, a lot of my net from my $40k income is free to grow and put towards more investments. One of my goals is to build a rental property portfolio to build wealth for myself and my family and also create enough passive income to live a nice lifestyle without having to be at the mercy of an employer. Both in the short term while i'm still young and healthy enough to enjoy the money (such as being able to travel on vacations without being too tired to walk up a flight of stairs because of old age), and also in the long term for a very comfortable retirement and a nice chunk of assets to leave behind for my family. I understand what 401k is for, but i'm also considering the short term as well, not only when i'm 59 and a half years old and beyond. I'm focusing on real estate being part of my retirement instead of a 401k. I think the benefits of real estate outweigh 401k with my specific goals in mind. Such as enjoying the fruits of real estate in my late 30's and my 40's, many years before i'd get to enjoy the fruits of the 401k. And also the exponential growth of building a real estate portfolio. And also not having to work for an employer for $50k per year max.

I'm thinking about maxing out my 401k as much as I can with my current income as a short term investment (roughly 5 years). I will contribute the amount that I can get matched from my employer, no more than that. My employer matches 50% up to 6% of income. I'm not completely sure what the vesting period is, but I assume it's the typical 3-5 years. In about 5 years I will have enough money saved to invest in my first rental property (which will become many more rental properties over the following years which will be part of my retirement later on), and also enough money saved to trade FOREX/stocks full-time as my income and quit my current job. So does it make sense to use my 401k to get an easy 50% return on investment per year from the company match for the next 5 years, and then withdraw it all in 5 years when I quit my job and start working for myself? I understand it defeats the purpose of a 401k, but since the company matches 50%, that 50% would easily cover the 10% penalty of early withdraw, and i'm going to pay income taxes on my contributions anyways whether it's in 5 years or in 30 years, so as long as I use the 401k money to put towards a real estate portfolio as a replacement retirement plan starting around age 34 or so, does it matter if i'm using the 401k in a way that it's not intended for? I was thinking maybe i'm better off using the 401k to make some easy profit on my income over the next 5 years instead of not contributing to 401k at all and hoping to make as much profit with the money invested elsewhere while I work full time. I've read about rolling the 401k over into a self directed IRA and investing in real estate with that and still taking advantage of tax deferral, but I don't really know the pros and cons of that compared to just taking the money out with some profit from the company match, paying the taxes and penalty, then just investing it into real estate and taking advantage of the benefits of it being outside of a self directed IRA, and the pros and cons of that vs using the self directed IRA. I'd like to hear some people's thoughts and maybe let me know if this is a bad idea, or a good idea, and why. Thanks."|0.53|1.0|0.0|1.0|['FOREX']

t3_18wdy7k|1704162170.0|investing|Increased cash to smooth out variance?|"To my knowledge, conventional wisdom is to adjust one’s holdings to a more conservative allocation as one nears retirement (say from an allocation heavily — or entirely — invested in equities, to an allocation that is closer to 60/40 or even 50/50), thus sacrificing a few percent in long-term returns in exchange for limiting variance/sequence risk.

What I’m wondering is if a better overall result might be achieved by keeping a significant amount of cash — say 2-3 years worth — on hand, and having a more aggressive allocation? In other words, considering that I plan to be retired for 30+ years, might it be feasible to “fill in the variance potholes” of an equity-focused allocation with cash during the down times (refilling the coffers during the up times), while taking advantage of better overall returns?

Retirement will be 12 years from now where I will start selling shares each year till death. Will be contributing anywhere from $2K-5K/month until retirement.

I'm familiar with the expense ratios and all the data around the different funds. Thing I like about SCHD is that is seems to weather downturns better than a total market index like FSKAX (but I am basing this statement mostly on the year 2022). I'm okay giving up huge gains to not dip so low when things go down. Also, the dividend difference heavily favors SCHD, which seems to act as a ballast when the market dips.

What gives me pause on using SCHD is it looks like it only did about 4.83% gain in 2023 whereas FSKAX did more than 26.65%. Obviously, if wide discrepancies like this continue several years in a row, it makes FSKAX probably the better choice. FSKAX also offers the diversification of a total market index.

Both only offer 12 years of history. Not a lot to go on. The future is an unknown. Was hoping people would share opinions, thoughts, insights and knowledge. There's lots I don't know and hopefully learning from this discussion will help me make my decision. (I want to only use one fund and not split up contributions.

Anyway, the prices per share of QQQ and VGT are pretty high (409 for QQQ and 484 for VGT), which has increased dramatically over the last 4 years or so.. my question is does the price of the ETF really matter?

Really just looking for discussion, and sharing what’s going on with my portfolio.  
  
So, I’m young, 23 years old. I have a well paying job and I have been investing since I was 19. My money kind of looks like this right now-  
  
Roth IRA- $27k spread into ETFs because I don’t want to risk my lump-sum retirement payment.  
  
Individual brokerage-    
$15k in JEPI, basically where I park some cash that I don’t want to spend on stocks if I find nothing attractive to purchase.  
  
$87k across 8 stocks, roughly the same position size, give or take a couple thousand.  
I own FICO, Mastercard, Visa, S&amp;P Global, Google, Texas Roadhouse, Markel Corp, and VICI. All these positions are in the green.  
  
So I’m highly concentrated in this portfolio, I believe what I own, I strongly believe they will continue to do well. Concentrating my positions has led to outsized returns… and truthfully I wouldn’t say I took much extra risk by owning so few stocks.  
  
Now the point of this post boils down to this: I would like to concentrate even more deeply into FICO, VISA, and S&amp;P Global because I think they are practically indestructible businesses. I’m willing to sell my TXRH and JEPI and split that ~$22k between the three.  
  
That would bring the allocation percentage of those three positions to approximately 17%, 19%, and 16%, respectively.  
(if you include my Mastercard position with visa, that number is actually up to 26%)  
  
I have been invested in these companies for a while and have been following the earnings reports for a couple years. These companies continue to absolutely kill it.  
  
This post is seeing if anyone has dealt with the same feelings regarding having a concentrated portfolio, because making these big, highly calculated decisions has served me well so far.

Does it even make sense to get rid of some of these if I'm planning to hold onto Berkshire, Alphabet etc for the foreseeable future? Is it basically just a case of letting the losers run and then offsetting them against any gains down the line?

I have traditionally avoided mutual funds partly because I read that actively managed funds - in the long run - underperform the Dow/S&amp;P/Nasdaq. I would like to move some funds into vehicles that track the performance of the S&amp;P (maybe 1/3 of the funds) and NASDAQ (other 2/3). However, I want to avoid two things if at all possible:

1) In-fund selling that results in taxable events for me. My understanding is that in “traditional” mutual funds, when managers sell out of ABC stock and pick up XYZ stock, if ABC was sold at a profit, then I get a year-end tax bill for that event…correct? I’m trying to avoid that sort of thing.

2) I think funds get hammered when the market declines or tanks. That’s when investors start redeeming their fund “shares”, which prompts the fund managers to sell holdings while values are low. I do NOT want that. I believe the time to buy is when people are running for the hills. Everyone says that of course (but low, sell high!) but in my experience people tend to act like a herd.

For the sake of these questions please forget about how old I am, retirement plans, etc. What are my options given what I’m trying to accomplish, and trying to avoid? TIA."|0.57|1.0|0.0|1.0|['NASDAQ', 'ABC']

t3_18vuthu|1704108011.0|investing|My conviction picks for the year|"My portfolio has elements of all-weather, with some conviction picks mixed in 

Basically

25% Nasdaq   
15% Long Term T-Bills  
15% Gold   
15% Consumer Staples  
10% Energy   
10% US Manufacturing - Conviction   
10% Indian Equities - Conviction 

Other than Consumer Staples and Energy, 2023 has been a very profitable year for me thanks to the december rally and my conviction picks playing out well   


1. For 2024, I'm still quite bullish on any stocks or ETFs related to the re-shoring theme in general as its an election year and it seems made-in-america is a slogan that will be a crying call for both parties. I think we're still in the early innings of a manufacturing resurgence in america and this theme can be milked for at least 1-2 years more before valuations become uncomfortably high 
2. I'm also maintaining my bullish stance on Indian equities even despite lofty valuations because many forget that India is largely a self-reliant, self-contained economy that can rely on domestic consumption to weather through any potential global slowdowns. Plus such domestic reliance helps a ton in a world of de-globalization (not to mention the added benefits of being touted as the next manufacturing centre of the world) I know that a lot of parties are looking to short Indian equities through a myriad of roundabout ways, but I think they may be in for a nasty surprise as the growth story continues 
3. Lastly, I'm thinking of adding some fx-unhedged japanese equities into my conviction mix. Departure from YCC, departure from decades long disinlation, and a growing need for a exit strategy will prompt the BOJ to begin lifting its negative real rates. The Yen has deviated close to 20% from its historical average against the dollar. Japanese equities have never looked better in terms of profit prospects. Capex spending is flowing once again. So to benefit from a double whammy of a strengthening yen and continued positive momentum of japanese stocks, I was thinking the fx-unhedged approach was valid.   


Anyways, outlined a brief brainstorm of what I'm thinking of for this year...appreciate any criticism or feedback "|0.42|0.0|0.0|0.0|['BOJ', 'fx', 'YCC']

I work for a company and we get RSUs which 1/3 vest each year or something. We also get a little bonus dependent on metrics. 

I was thinking of investing all of it. Obviously I can take no action and RSUs automatically get rolled into 401k according to leadership.

I was also thinking of selling them and just investing by myself in Robinhood maybe QQQ, VGT or IBLC or something. The problem with this is I’m not that comfortable with managing the numbers. I’m fine with just dumping money in and letting Robinhood  send me a form with how much to save if I were to cash out all at once. I wouldn’t be trading around much mostly letting it ride on whichever diversified funds. 

Third option is to get a broker to manage for me maybe the same one that does my 401k. Not sure if the fees would be terrible if I’m not adding that much very often or if my gains would be limited and not able to say “hey throw some at this etf/index”. 

I know if I save $$&amp; in my savings or checking account it will be GONE. 

Just want a good way to semi-automatically invest $500/month or up to $7,000 a yr. I’m a little unsure of the high management fee of the IBLC etf.

This shift is not coincidence as banks charge the rate the Feds are offerring plus an appropriate bonus based on the risk. Ergo when the Feds raise rates  the risk load in the economy simply shifts from the private sector to the public sector. By extension it could be said that ultimately interest rates and average/public debt loads do not matter simply because the economy is going to tollerate whatever amount of risk that it wants and there's nothing anyone can do about it.

It is likewise important to remember that borrowed money is far from the only risk around because of operational risk. Most loans ultimately go to relatively safe ventures like buying a house or building a factory. I won't name any names, but there are developed nations with high debt loads considered safe while there are third world states with state-run piracy that are considered risky with miniscule debt loads.

My goal is to invest $5,000 up front.

Problem is I don't know where to even start. I have a schwab brokerage account but I never use it and I only have $1000 in it. 

The reason I bring up the amount of money I have in it is because I might want to utilize their financial planners but I have to call them and see how that works.

The issue is I just don't know where to even start. I have read that a 529 plan is the best thing, but I don't like how that limits your child to only spending money on their education. Although I want my child to be educated, I'm not sure what the world will be like in 20 years. I'm not sure if people will go to trade schools or do something different than college like they do now. I don't want him to be limited with what he can do with the money, especially because things are always changing and I don't want the money to be frozen up because he can't use it for what he wants.

I've also been told about CDs. And also just investing in the s&amp;p 500 index and just letting it accumulate from there.

I don't even know what my goal should be. He's already one years old. So let's say that I want to give him the money when he's 18, 19 or 20. So that gives me roughly the most 19 years to accumulate this money.

Or maybe it would be better if I gave him money at 25? I don't know. I know the brain develops at 25 lol

Can anyone point me in the right direction on where to start with this. Also what is your personal preference? Do most people think that the 529 plan is the smartest route to go? Should I do a mix of a 529 plan and investing in the s&amp;p 500 index.

t3_18v3s5e|1704013141.0|investing|Investing in software companies (tin foil chat)|"Wanted to share some thought on how to pick stocks in technology. I want to focus on the quality of revenue. I did t know this until I spoke with a few experts and got me thinking about fraud and if there is a method to spot fraud in technology consistently. 

I was brought up in the UK in the 90s and 00s where some managers made a fortune by investing in internet companies. Most of those people were long only investors and the horizon was super long. Their main thesis was around changes in society, habitual changes, that would have led to some internet companies to show abnormal growth in stock price. Amazon, Google, FB, Microsoft etc. These managers literally became millionaires. 

The legacy of these managers dies hard and there are many money managers betting on healthcare tech (bio tech), food industries or energy transition. Their bets are almost always driven by top down analysis, instead of understanding the operations of each company. Most of these firms generate their money from licensing. 

Licensing revenue has distinct characteristics such as
- multi year firm wide contract 
- cost of switching tends to be expensive 
- once signed, your revenue is basically guaranteed for a good few years 

One often overlooked is the fact that companies have a great leeway on when to book/show sales and cancellations in their book if and when these multi year licensing contracts get cancelled.

Imagine a hypothetical scenario where a firm sells a licensing agreement. The customer gives a notice or intent to cancel this licensing agreement at the end of the term or even in the middle of it for whatever reasons.  
- there is often penalty involved in early termination 
- the notice period is longer often in months

How does this cancellation appear in your quarterly or semi annual reports?

For this potential loss to appear in the official report, you would need this cancellation to be passed to a relevant department and recorded. 

How does a customer give a notice to the firm of the intention to cancel the licensing agreement? Through their sales or relationship contact. 

Once the sales team receives this cancellation, is there a process that gets initiated or can the sales team decide when to pass this cancellation notice to their management? 

This cancellation doesn’t look good on the sales team that covers that region or customer type. Particularly if the contract amount was large, the bonus would be impacted. The sales team often starts a campaign to minimize the impact of the cancellation or at least understand why the contract is being terminated. These campaigns, due to the nature of the contract, could run months, right up to the date of the actual cancellation. And from what I hear, not very effective use of the sales teams time. 

At what point, is the sales team forced to record this cancellation in their book? I think they will delay recording this loss of revenue till the very last day or they try to smooth the loss by booking this loss when there is a significant gain in revenue (new contract for example). 

Does the same happen to new customer acquisitions? It could. Maybe preferable to record a new sale in certain months, due to accounting or reporting reasons, or bonus reasons. 

For these reasons, technology firms revenue sometimes appears incredibly smooth, smooth because they are cooked, not by management of the firm that might have no knowledge of the book cooking of this nature, but rather on the ground by those who carry out day to day jobs. 

This makes me want to spot firms without proper governance to short them. Firms seemingly doing well are the targets. Firms that rely on a few products are the targets instead of large diversified firms. 

Eventually I think regulators will step in, but at the moment, they don’t seem to have much clue around technology licensing businesses.

Based on my age, state and health, my estimated premium is 1,600 a year, and he recommends I pay annually instead of monthly. 

I find it attractive as the money is compounded, there are life benefit payouts (as opposed to term insurance which is only cashed out during death), and there’s a return floor.

I'm not sure how that kind of thing is received on this sub, being only a very occasional visitor myself. On one hand I know you guys are experienced, even so, tampering with the pension feels like a massive step, even feeling relatively confident myself..

For background, my pension is with Aegon, 5% matched salary with my employer and i'm in the UK. I did the above for 2 reasons; firstly, it was horribly overweighted in bonds, too much for my liking at 32 years old. And I have the risk apetite to go equity heavy until a little later down the line. Secondly, it was a mixture of actively managed funds, this didn't have my confidence as from what i've read, the proportion of active managed beating index trackers over the long run are extremely low.

My new portfolio therefore looks like this: (apologies, I dont have the tikr and i'm too lazy to hunt at the moment)

Vanguard ESG developed world all-cap Index @86.6%

Vanguard ESG Emerging Markets index @10%

Vanguard global bond index fund hedged @3%

Cash (for account fees) @0.4%

My reasoning as I began touching on above is that I didnt like actively managed or bond heavy. Even Ray Dalio with his all weather fund has came out in recent times of high inflation and said that bonds are money losers in this climate. So an equity heavy bastardised 3 fund portfolio giving global diversification is what i've rested on.

Thoughts? Do you feel i'm over diversified? Would you include other asset classes or reweight the portfolio? Or do you feel i'd benefit more from another global equity for cheaper ongoing charges? I do realise the ESGs are approx 0.2% as opposed to other Vanguard funds. I do have other investment options outside of Vanguard, but most aren't as cheap. I feel this could be the fund or nearly the fund to carry my through the next 30 years, woth gradual reweighting in favour of bonds.

1 misunderstanding i may have is if i'm retired and and the 18y/o isn't doing college and i don't have income outside of my rothIRA and 401k, could I still be funding my rothIRA? I feel like you have to have income in order to fund the rothIRA?  but may 401k and rothIRA withdrawals counts as income? :shruggie:

I hope that makes sense, it's kind of convoluted, but I wanted to address the unknowns of a future kid not doing college while also taking advantage of the new 2024 law to get more money in my investments (potentially). Thanks!"|0.8|3.0|0.0|3.0|[]

           i. Traditional IRA account shows unsettled balance of 6500$ (funds will be available to transfer on 1/5/2024)
           ii. Traditional IRA account’s summary shows I have contributed to 2023’s limit of 6500$

2. Due to the situation mentioned above in 1. i., I am unable to complete the Roth conversion by end of December, 2023.
        
I have these following questions now:

1. Have I missed 2023’s back door IRA conversion and owe taxes on the unsettled balance on my traditional IRA?
2. Is there a specific way I can file taxes in 2024, so I can claim that 6500$ contribution as backdoor Roth IRA?

I’m confused since the contribution on summary page shows I have contributed for 2023 but the Roth conversion can happen only in 2024."|0.67|1.0|0.0|1.0|['i.']

There are still some limitations. The 529 account must have been open for 15 years and account holders can’t roll over contributions made in the last five years. Rollovers are subject to the annual Roth IRA contribution limit, and there’s a $35,000 lifetime cap on 529-to-Roth transfers.

Gold by itself is a lot more volatile than a total bond fund. But, gold is also quite a bit less correlated to the US stock market compared to bonds. So, adding a limited amount of gold to a portfolio seems to provide the same decrease in volatility as adding a limited amount of bonds.
Why is a limited (10-20%) gold almost never recommended by professionals?

So I was at my wife’s college reunion the other day and it was at her friend’s parent’s house. Needless to say I was blown away. It was easily 20,000 ft.², in the best part of town and clearly no expense was spared. The father is also building his daughter an 11,000 ft.² house down the road.

Why am I mentioning any of this? I asked my wife how he made his money and from what she knows, he sold his family-owned golf course for $9.4 million in 2006 and then bought three car washes (that also house car detailing and mechanic services) and has been on the up and up ever since. Factor in taxes etc and that would not come close to covering the cost of his lifestyle- trust me. Building the house easily cost $9m. With the exception of the golf course which his father picked up back in the day for peanuts, he and his family literally came from nothing, 900 sq ft housing a family of six- very blue collar. I realize that $9.4 million is an enormous amount of money but this guy lives like a guy worth $50m +. 

They travel only by private jet, stay in only five star hotels, and appear to have a bottomless pit of money. You get the idea.

Some quick math:

20,000 ft.² X 600 per sq ft = $12m built in 2015 (he paid cash for everything including purchase price)

11,000 ft.² X 600 per Sq ft = $6.6m in progress.

(He managed the construction of both houses and subbed everything out, so the cost was possibly substantially less than above figures)

$500k annual household budget (estimate)

Are there any car wash owners here or business owners who could offer their two cents on this enormous compounding of capital? Could this guy earn millions for himself every year from car washes? I looked up the company online and it says their revenues are $6.8 million. He could have invested everything in Facebook for all I know but from the background check I did it online looks like the car washes are his main assets. 

I know it’s very limited information. I can try to provide more information if I can. Thanks in advance"|0.31|0.0|0.0|0.0|[]

The company has made significant strides in the clinical development and is now seeking regulatory approval.  
  
**EU Approval**  
  
In November 2023, Anavex submitted a full approval application for Blarcamesine to the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The EMA has recommended that Anavex proceed with this application earlier this month.  
  
The EU approval process is typically slower than the U.S. FDA approval process. However, the EMA has the potential to fast-track Blarcamesine due to its promising efficacy and safety profile.  
  
**U.S. FDA Approval**  
  
Anavex is also seeking accelerated approval for Blarcamesine from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Accelerated approval is granted to drugs that show a positive effect on a surrogate biomarker, such as amyloid plaques or tau protein levels.  
  
In September 2023, Anavex announced that Blarcamesine had lowered the levels of amyloid plaques in the brain. The company also found that Blarcamesine slowed the loss of brain volume. Both findings were statistically significant.  
  
The FDA has granted accelerated approval to other Alzheimer's drugs based on biomarker data alone. Therefore, it is possible that the FDA could grant accelerated approval to Blarcamesine.  
  
**Timeline**  
  
Anavex has not set a specific release date for Blarcamesine. However, the company has indicated it expects the drug could be approved in 2024. Here is a possible timeline for Blarcamesine approval:  
  
**EU Approval: Early 2024**  
**U.S. FDA Accelerated Approval: Spring or summer 2024**  
**U.S. FDA Regular Approval: Late 2024 or early 2025**  
  
**Conclusion**  
  
Anavex's Alzheimer's drug has the potential to be a major breakthrough in the treatment of this debilitating disease. The company is making progress in the clinical development and regulatory approval process. If all goes well Blarcamesine could be available to patients in 2024 🤞🤞🤞  
  
**Additional Considerations**  
  
Blarcamesine seems to be more effective than Leqembi, the only other Alzheimer's drug approved in the past decade (developed by Biogen). Blarcamesine seems to be much safer than Leqembi, since there have been no deaths caused by Blarcamesine.  


The global Alzheimer's market is estimated to be worth over **$40B** annually.

Long **AVXL Anavex** (potential promising treatment) and **BIIB Biogen** (approved drug but has severe side effects). This is **NOT** investment advice.

t3_18t0ss4|1703788020.0|investing|The NYTs is suing Microsoft and I think there is a profitability play on their stocks|"What Happened
Headlines yesterday were championed by the largest copyright lawsuit in the Manhattan Federal Court: The New York Times sues Microsoft and OpenAI. The copyright infringement lawsuit against the companies says that both used the newspaper’s content to train their models without permission. In doing so, the companies jeopardized Time’s business in its entirety. The Times also suggested in the filing that both companies should be liable for BILLIONS of damages. What prompted the lawsuit? Failed negotiations between the involved parties over the usage of Times material. They also stated they were worried about AI attributing false information to the newspaper. I guess when money is on the line news outlets decide to worry about whether their information is accurate or not. Now here is the real kicker - the Times is calling for both OpenAI and Microsoft to destroy all chatbots that use Times material. With OpenAI’s valuation, currently over $80 bn, coming almost completely from ChatGPT, this could compromise the integrity of the entire company. 

The Simple Sides (My) Take
The bad news is that I am not a legal professional and truly have no idea how this will go. While I do hold my own opinions, I have reached out to multiple lawyers to get more professional opinions and will be sure to add them here when they respond. In the meantime let’s jump into a couple of completely feasible outcomes. 

The entire lawsuit is kaput: a.k.a, insignificant or thrown out 
To me, this lawsuit is somewhat of a joke: “Newspaper upset that companies use articles available online.” I honestly DO NOT think the lawsuit will amount to much. It seems like journalists at the Times are worried that they are going to lose money and jobs to AI and aren’t happy about it - rightfully so. However, being scared and upset about AI replacing you isn’t a good reason to cry out to the long arm of the law. When the case gets underway it will be interesting to see the arguments presented by the legal team for the Times. 

The New York Times wins the lawsuit
If the Times wins the lawsuit it could be a major step in journalism’s fight against AI. Not only would the victory set a legal precedent for future AI copyright cases, but it would mean significant damages being paid to the Times. They (the Times) could come into billions of dollars, possibly boosting the stock (ticker: NYT) to 52-week highs. This could also lead to a revaluation of the AI industry. If websites can “charge” for AI models training on their information, the profitability scales might shift. The more content you have online the more you could capitalize on AI models. AI companies are also not heavily regulated at the moment. A win for the Times could shift lawmakers’ attention to the growing market sector.

Microsoft and OpenAI win the lawsuit 
Similar to if the Times won, there would be a legal precedent set - AI models can be trained on any information. This could also reinforce the current AI industry and lead to possible growth in valuations for AI-invested stocks. The New York Times would also likely experience some negative effects, possibly paying lawyer fees for both defendants. In layman’s terms, Microsoft stock would be soaring up and the New York Times would be diving down. 

Stock Movements Based on Lawsuit Outcomes
We see the MSFT and NYT stocks moving in all sorts of directions depending on the outcome of the pending lawsuit. No need to worry, you’re reading The Simple Side, so we’re gonna break it down for you. If nothing happens and the lawsuit is thrown out then Microsoft might suffer some residual damage from the negative headlines, but the stock price will remain relatively steady. If the New York Times wins then its stock will likely jump up probably both in the short and mid-term, but Microsoft will likely have a significant short-term drop. If Microsoft wins then its stock will jump in both the short and mid-to-long-term, whereas the Times stock will drop in the short term and likely recover within the mid-term.

Could capitalize using options trade strategies. I wrote a full article about this and the profitability of the trades but out of respect for the “no promotion” sub guidelines I can’t post links.

For example, QQQ and QQQM follow the exact same basket of stocks (NASDAQ 100) but one has an expense ratio of 0.2% while the second has an expense ratio of 0.15%.

It was for a survey where you selected a series of hypothetical investment choices for investing a hypothetical $1,000, and at the end you got a gift card for participating and also a 1/100 chance of receiving in cash the results of your hypothetical investment.

The survey looked legit, it was hosted by qualtronics I think, but for certain the URL did not look suspicious to me.   I completed it but then have heard nothing since.  If it was a phishing scam, the info they got would just be an email address and what brokerage firm(s) the participant used.

Had a quick question that I wanted to run by the group. I've been building together a checklist for evaluating new stocks and one metric that I've been mulling over the last few days is Return on Net Tangible Assets (RONTA). There isn't a whole lot of coverage on this metric and when there is, the equations differ (some just take out intangible assets and goodwill from total assets and subtract from total liabilities, while others also take out interest bearing liabilities).

  
Does anyone look at this metric when evaluating new companies? While obviously you would need to benchmark this % against comparable companies/industries, I'm having a hard time interpreting it in the sense that the metric doesn't seem really useful for tech companies where goodwill/intangibles are a large % of total assets and would thus have an inflated percentage. Maybe it would be useful just for financial/manufacturing/etc. companies?

  
Also, when I look at a company like $DGX who is in healthcare, their RONTA % is 30-40%, which seems pretty good, but then I'm not sure it makes sense to take out goodwill since they have been growing mostly through acquisitions. So, would ROA % be better for them?

Given that ridiculous rate, I'm thinking it's better to just pay the minimum on the mortgage while doing weekly DCA into an ETF (e.g. VTI, VOO) to accumulate a payoff sum by 2040.  With no additional payments in 17 years, I'll have an $85k balance left on the note.  If I start now and DCA $50/week into an ETF which manages a 7% return, that totals $83k from the $44k in deposits.  To pay off the loan in 17 years, I'd need to add $300/mo to the payment totalling $68k. Other than market risks, is there something I'm missing here?|0.29|0.0|0.0|0.0|['DCA']

Tldr: will have just enough next year to make a down payment for a house, uncertain if that's the smart decision, or if it's best to save further so net value doesn't go to near zero. 

44M, wife and a 5yr old son, living in a rented house in Europe (Portugal). Net worth around 80k euros, 70k in the market (100% stocks), the rest in a bank account, for day to day + any unexpected needs.

While maintaining our standards of life, I expect to be able to add around 35k to investment account in 2024, and between 15 to 20k a year from 2025 onwards (I will take a sort of pay cut in 2025 as some temporary tax breaks will end). 

Life Goals:
	- Buy a house in Lisbon (to live in now, and leave it to my son in the future) 
	- Buy a house in Madeira (to live in after retirement) 
	- Retire around 60-65
	
Currently losing sleep over the following:
Get to 100k euros and make a down payment for an apartment in Lisbon in mid 2024
 OR 
stay invested and living in a rental until reaching 200k euros (in 4 years or less, hopefully), and then take 100k out to make the down payment?

I am dreading having to start the investments from zero again. Bought my first stock in 2020, made huge mistakes in 2021 and 22 (didn't sell , rode from the top all the way down until near oblivion, bought options, took out personal credit, etc) and then gained some sense in 2023, and will end this year at around +30%. Also, I'm now 100% debt free.

On the other hand, the market taking another downturn is scary as well, even though I'm convinced we'll have years of positive returns ahead of us, with the interest rates going down (which should also help with more accessible housing prices...) 

Anyone facing similar dilemma? In general, is it smart to get out of the market and essentially start over when you reach just enough for a goal of yours, or stay in until there's still some capital left to grow?

**Analysis: Looking at Dollar &amp; Small Caps:**  
**DOLLAR:**  


* DXY is now down 3% since the Dec 13th Fed meeting, and 5% down since November, on rate cut optimism. Let’s look at what the data is telling us about what traders are expecting going forward now. 
* If we compare the CDX to DXY, we can see that Corporate bond traders expect the dollar to continue to fall from here. (See the analog below. DXY tends to track CDX)
   * [https://imgur.com/a/fYBFuvz](https://imgur.com/a/fYBFuvz)
* The bloomberg risk reversal index also just hit the low of the year. This also tells us that the dollar is expected to remain under pressure. 
   * [https://imgur.com/a/jSD1jAr](https://imgur.com/a/jSD1jAr)   
* Conclusion: Dollar to remain under pressure. This is positive for the equity markets. A falling dollar should continue to support equity markets higher.   


**Small Caps:**  


* Since October, Small caps have rallied as investors rotate out of Mag 7. 
* If we track the IWM against SPY (Small caps vs Big caps), we can see that the IWM is testing the resistance of a medium term downtrend. 
   * [https://imgur.com/a/bHZH7J2](https://imgur.com/a/bHZH7J2)   
* What this tells us is that we could see some short term correction in small cap stocks, many of which have rallied significantly. 
* This is what the Skew Data is telling us too. IV in OTM call options has reduced, and there is a gamma resistance at 105 on IWM. 
* All of this tells us that we could see some price correction in IWM soon.
* However, long term the momentum is still strong for small caps. Flows into corporate bonds remain supportive.
   * [https://imgur.com/a/K5SEMLM](https://imgur.com/a/K5SEMLM)     


**What happened yesterday and what are my thoughts on it?**  


* Boxing Day is historically the 2nd best trading day of the year, with average returns of 0.5%. Yesterday’s returns was 0.42%.
* SPX opened around 4761, before moving higher. Intraday, it moved above the 4775 level, which has formed a resistance throughout last week. Couldn't break notably above it, so will continue to watch this level today. This was likely due to lack of data and volume in the market. Ultimately, sellers were sitting at this level. 
* The drop in dollar as well as seasonal boost is what supported market yesterday. 
* Oil outperformed on falling dollar and as US bought 3 million barrels for their strategic reserve. 
* Nio popped after unveiling new sedan, whilst Intel dragged other semis higher after securing funding for new project in Israel  


**——— INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCH ———**   


* ANZ - USDJPY will eventually move lower to 136 by the end of 2024
* ANZ sees AUD/USD at 0.68 in Q1 and 0.7 in Q4. Driven by USD drop and developments in China. RBA will only cut at end of 2024, whilst Fed would start cutting before. Also risk positive sentiment. 
* BBH says they expect Dollar to remain under pressure this week. Lack of any major data to slow downward momentum. 
* BCA research compared historic relationship between bank lending standards and commercial and industrial loans. Suggested that history tells us commercial and industrial loans will be down 10% by H2 2024. Said this only happens in recessions.

Investing in the S&amp;P 500 for example gives you a much better chance at doubling your money but it might take ~10 years.  

Is there a way to essentially “gamble” in the market on a short term time basis where the upside is potentially doubling your money, the outcome of your “bet” is realized much more quickly and you have say at least a 40% chance of “winning”? 

Not really interested in penny stocks and haven’t explored Puts much.  Thanks!

Edit: I should have noted, I’m not suggesting this as a strategy for wealth building.  More just a potential outlet for “fun”, discretionary spending in the same way sports gambling can be entertaining if done responsibly.

We reliably bring home $11,000-$11,500 monthly. We are in the 1st half of our 30's.

Four years back, I got ""lured"" into doing some insurance(?) at MetLife where I invest 400$ a month and they manage this, some kind of investment, not entirely sure of the details as I don't have the policy right in front of me.

I have had regular yearly meetings with representatives discussing details, perforamnce, etc.

Last year, when they showed me the performance it was like -10% or so.

Now, after started investing there it sparked my interest so I did some reading and created a portfolio of my own (not huge, but of about 50k$) and managed to get a return of 114.7% to date (i.e. roughly 2 years). I have mostly been doing swing trading in the TechStock market as I work in the field of IT.

That being said, understanding more or less how the markets work, it seems that investing in an ETF myself would be way better than MetLife handling any of my money (not only do they manage to underpofrm against the market, but also take some fee).

The money I put there are solely for my kids so I don't really want to do any kind of trading with them as I have a long period span of 18+ years to invest and wait.

  
**TLDR**: Started inveting in MetLife, they seem to underpform disasterously and I think to start investing into an ETF myself as I have gained some experience the past few years.

**The Question:** I want to start investing these 400$ a month ( as I curently have the option to opt out of investing in MetLife without any fee) as well as money coming from relatives for birthdays, Christmas, etc. (we get the kids enough presents anyway and I think we are doing rather well with income for Europe) into S&amp;P500.

Treat them as just one data point among many.

* A year that investors don't have to be afraid because so many things are improving. The main thing is that the Fed won't be fighting an inflation war. We are also in an earnings recovery cycle (earnings bottomed in the 3rd quarter)
* Bullish on small caps for 2024. Number one pick is the IWM
* 10-year treasury has a lot of room to come down in 2024. Brings down mortgage rates. This means being invested in groups that are sensitive to falling interest rates (e.g. interest rates and financials) and improving housing
* Number one large cap sector pick: financials, industrials, and technology
* Capex recovery next year because surveys show everyone was too cautious this year
* Back-end loaded year in 2024. More money made in second half. Base case is the S&amp;P is flat or down 5% in the first half. There's likely going to be a growth scare in the first half (anxiety from the start of rate hikes)

I made a lot of changes to my portfolio this year eliminating all bonds and going 100% stocks as this is a taxable account.  I put all the bonds in my IRAs.  

I was also heavily overweighted to dividend stocks at the beginning of the year which contributed to my underperformance.

In Romania (BET), much like the rest of Europe, there's been a surge in support for fringe parties. While political and fiscal challenges persist, Romania's potential entry into Schengen in the next few years could significantly boost the economy.

So currently my work has an Employee Stock Purchasing Plan with a 15% match, and as a result I have been consistently contributing into that. I have recently moved my shares into my own private Fidelity brokerage account. I’m a young college student so it is not an insane amount of money, but it is about $4,500 so it’s still a significant amount to me at this stage of my life. My question is whether I should keep the stocks or reallocate them? 
I was always told to not have “all your eggs in one basket” so having the money all in one stock (it’s a blue retail company) doesn’t seem like the best strategy to me. I’ve thought about it and I could sell my shares and by a ETF like VOO or VTI, I could buy a company with a higher dividend, or I could put the money into a Roth-IRA. 

I’m at the pivotal moment of graduating next semester, so while I know that the Roth is probably the best call for me long term I know that I cannot withdrawal for a substantial time. It would nice to be able to have access to the funds in the case of an emergency and I suppose that I could put it in a HYSA, however I know that the market growth in average is much higher.

Additionally I’m not sure if selling is the best idea because I know I’ll have to pay taxes on the gains, but I’ll be honest I’m not entirely sure about the specifics of that.

My wife has an ESPP for the first time.  Her first six-month purchase period concludes this Friday, 12/29, and then the shares will be automatically purchased that day (managed by Fidelity).  The company's stock price tends to bounce up and down a lot, but as of today, it is up 7% versus the beginning of the purchase period.  The shares will be purchased with a 15% discount on the share price at the beginning of the six months since that price is the lower of the beginning and end of the six months (unless there is a big drop this week, of course).  So we should make a nice profit beyond the 15% assuming there is no major drop.

There is no mandatory holding period for the shares purchased.  Because the stock price does bounce up and down pretty substantially from day-to-day, I would like to go ahead and sell on Friday if the price is up.  Is that even possible?  Would Fidelity process the stock purchase quickly enough for us to be able to go ahead and sell almost instantly on the same day?

Lots of people say once snowball begins you really feel the power of dividends.

I have another 35 years before retirement anyway and residency is UK but more and more doing calculations of profit after each year finish I realise dividends is like fake hope. For example first year my dividends payout was £16.43. This year is £900 range and next year projected £1400 which seems good on paper but these very dividends stock could have been replaced with growth and instead of small realized gains I would of had way more unrealised gains.

But more on reits there is even research that Reits most years outperform SP500 due to the power of reinvesting dividends but after holding
Vici (risk but growth) Realty Income (passive but monthly dividend and super diversified) I realised they are both very passive boring stocks both together are 15% of my portfolio.

Of course during high interest rates you wouldnt expect Reits to be exciting but I just did future conservative calculations and slightly doubt whether its even worth holding Reits. Posting here whether I missed something from my calculations that makes it so one sided

Like the way I see snowball effect is when it's growth is  exponential and I thought if for example Realty Income pays you £45 per month that would be enough to buy 1 whole share right  so calculations are you need 264 shares which is £11,880


Year 1 
264 shares +£45 dividend monthly
Month 1 
264+45
Month 2
265+45.05
Month 3
266+45.22
Month 4

Month 10
273 +46.41
Month 11
274 +46.58
Month 12
275 +46.75

1 year from 
264 shares =11,880

To
11,880 +3% annual growth =12,236
+reinvested shares 11 =495
=12,731
7.2% growth

But if invested in growth stock 
11,880 +20%
1 year =14,256


So I thought snowball effect doesn't really happen with 11k into Reits but what if I was able to buy 4 Realty Income shares every month is that snowball effect?


£57,000 = 1266 shares
=£215.22 per month gives you 4.7 shares at current price

Year 1

Only reason I chose Realty Income is because it's extremely safe stable diversified stock pays 5% but even with 60k invested I still don't see snowball effect of course everyone says just put it into VUSA and forget but dividend investors talk about how they can outperform sp500 but I don't see whether its even worth trying 

Maybe in your last 5 years employed you start exchanging your growth stocks and ETFs for Reits for passive Income but slowly I realized recently, investing into passive dividend stocks while young is a big waste of time and illusion to provide passive Income that isn't there. You can compare year 1 dividends received to current year and say wow snowball effect is real but when you take into consideration on how much growth you missed out. Makes me feel my investing strategy has been used 30 years too early 

Even when my portfolio consist of 55% Apple &amp; MSFT just mistakes like TROW DIS SOFI my portfolio every year for 5 years is 3-7% lower than VUSA.

I’ve done a bunch of research, but I have a hard time making decisions regarding which funds, what percentage, etc. I know I want balanced risk, and I want it to be index funds if possible, and diversified well. Nothing fancy. (For context, I'm in my 30s. have good savings, have a 401k at work, and some ibonds and CDs, in addition to this.)

I spoke with a Fidelity advisor. He showed me the ETF Portfolio Builder tool that they have on their site, and recommended I use it. Using the tool, I put in the amount I’m investing, which at this time is the full $6,500, since I didn’t do it earlier in the year. For investment objective, I selected “Growth”. You can then choose a “Model Type”, which is “Fidelity-only”, or “ iShares &amp; Fidelity”.

Initially, I selected the Fidelity-only model. I’m attaching a screenshot of their breakdown recommendation. [Screenshot 1](https://imgur.com/eEdYjxi) and [screenshot 2](https://imgur.com/epQEMTQ). I’d noticed that there weren’t any index funds in the breakdown. I guess because Fidelity doesn’t have a Fidelity-specific ETF index fund? What do you think about the breakdown?

I then selected the iShares &amp; Fidelity model. That one did give me an index option. [Screenshot 1](https://imgur.com/Pi2st78) and [screenshot 2](https://imgur.com/roE52DP). So, is there much of a difference between selecting that iShare index vs. say, Vanguard or other? And what do you think about that breakdown vs the Fidelity-only one?

* Am I missing any other obvious choices ? Or will these together encapsulate the most broad market commodity trends ? 

* Due to the high number of gold mining exposure that 2 of these ETFs posses will it give me the same result as investing in gold as a inflation and market crash hedge.

Culture.

They are perpetual innovation machines.

Sometimes, their culture goes astray but eventually it gets fixed.

When culture goes south, the company goes south.

When it gets fixed, the company goes back to doing well.

Culture is a result of a series of excellent organizational properties.

All companies that I own that have an excellent culture (which again, is a condensation of many aspects) just continue doing well.

Those that do not, eventually turn into losers.

Take $MSFT for instance.

The stock was flat from the year 2000 to the year 2014.

Why? Because Steve Ballmer operated a culture that sucked.

High in politics, low in innovation.

People were scared to fail, so no one shared ideas.

Good news moved fast around the company. Bad news, not so much.

Then came Satya and totally transformed the culture.

$MSFT shifted to being low in politics, high in meritocracy.

High in individual courage. Courage to innovate, share ideas and fail over and over until success comes.

Decentralized operations. Bad news now move around the company just as fast as good news.

All of a sudden, the company is now an unstoppable innovation machine.

Don't believe me? Read Satya's shareholder letters.

Read Jeff Bezos' work.

Read Sam Walton's work.

They all understand/understood this.

They all think the same and their organizations are fundamentally the same.

I am seeking advice on why you should keep money in 401k plan vs rolling it over periodically into a Roth IRA. I was looking at some numbers and came up with this:

**ROLLING OVER ROUTE**

* Lets assume you + employer contribute 22,500 into 401k this year.
* 13,500 goes into Roth ITA after rolling it over (takes a 40% tax hit).
* At a 6% return rate over 30 years, you end up with **81.3k**


Alternatively, 

**KEEPING 401k ROUTE**

* You + employer contribute 22,500 into 401k this year.
* At a 6% return rate over 30 years, you end up with 135.5k.
* Taxed at 40% upon withdrawal, this results in **81.3k**

Since both variants result in the same amount of money after 30 years, what benefits does leaving money in 401k over Roth IRA provide? I am predicting to remain in a high tax bracket post retirement. My view is that a Roth IRA will provide you with more flexibility and higher potential growth if you were to trade with that account, such as selling options against your positions.

If years later you sell the stock at a higher price then you have to pay capital gains tax on it. This isn't exactly fair as this doesn't account for inflation. If you hold a stock and the price doesn't go up, and then 10 years later sell it, you have lost a significant amount of purchasing power due to inflation.

It would be ideal if there was a way to adjust your cost basis vis-a-vis the inflation over that period. This would account for reduced capital gains, but also enabling a capital loss as the cost basis adjust upwards.

Investors would then know how they are doing vs. inflation, and have a true metric on their investments, and the government would be more motivated to deal with inflation when it occurs. Further, people we would be incentivized to invest their cash instead of leaving it on the sideline.

Which is correct. But what if you consistently bought (DCA) but only at the end of down days/weeks? Would the average price you pay be lower than DCA-ing every day/week? Would you have to buy more than you normally would to make up for the money not invested on up days?

Edit: so I ended up writing a script that tested both strategies (DCA and buying on down weeks) using S&amp;P500 data from 2010-2020 and the maximum possible performance increase (with perfect knowledge of how many down weeks there will be in the given timeframe) is about 2% over 10 years.

I made 3 purchases between July and November of last year, and it appears the yield for the latest one I purchased will finally dip below 4% in another month or so.

This isn't money I expect to need for quite some time, and my risk-tolerance for this specific chunk of savings is medium.

t3_18oksy0|1703267772.0|investing|Roth IRA vs Cash vs Margin Accounts|"&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to understand if my math (and logic) is correct when comparing gains on like-trades but in different account types. For reference, my investment amount will be $200,000 via TD Ameritrade/Charles Schwab, 15% tax rate, and 13.00% effective margin rate. 28 years old. Employed. Not married. No children.

&amp;#x200B;

AAPL 2023 YTD performance is \~+55.25%. Past performance is not indicative of future results, I know. According to 1stock1, between 1981 and 2022, Apple has been positive 27 of those 42 years, with the strongest being +211.90% and the weakest being +5.42%. The average of the positive years is +67.8103704%. Apple has been negative 15 of those 42 years, with the worst being -71.06% and the least being -4.17%. The average of the negative years is -29.092%. 1995 to 1997 (3 years) was Apple's longest consecutive yearly losing streak. 2009 to 2014 (6 years) was Apple's longest consecutive yearly gain streak. The average of all 42 years is +33.202381%.

&amp;#x200B;

Roth IRA contribution limit in 2024 is $7,000. Non-deductible. Tax-free at distribution in retirement. $7,000 + 30% = $9,100. Gain of $2,100

&amp;#x200B;

Cash account of $7,000 + 30% = $9,100. Gain of $2,100 - 15% (tax) = Gain of $1,785

&amp;#x200B;

I can see that in this example, the Roth IRA is the better choice as opposed to the cash account. However, the Roth IRA is limited to the $7,000 annual contribution. Any additional investing must be done in the cash account. As a result, the current optimal solution would be to contribute into the Roth IRA up to the limit and invest the remaining $193,000 in the cash account and continuing the annual contribution into the Roth IRA in following years.

&amp;#x200B;

Margin account of $7,000 + $7,000 (margin) = $14,000. $14,000 + 30% = $18,200. Gain of $4,200 - 15% (tax) = Gain of $3,570 - my cost of margin for 1 year which is (.13 \* 7000) = Gain of $3,570 - $910 (margin) = Gain of $2,660.

&amp;#x200B;

I can see that in this example, with the same $7,000, AFTER taxes AND cost of margin, the margin account is the better choice as opposed to both the cash account and the Roth IRA. Similar to the cash account, I have no annual contribution limit, can withdraw at any time, and can invest the full $200,000. With margin, this amount becomes $400,000. As a result, the current optimal solution appears to be investing the full amount of $200,000 + $200,000 in the margin account and disregarding the Roth IRA entirely.

&amp;#x200B;

While I take much greater risks investing that amount in a margin account and having the knowledge/information that the average of Apple's yearly losses is \~-30%, over the long term, it's clear on paper that the optimal strategy is to go full margin, with the honest hope that the first 2-3 years are positive. I also expect my current effective margin rate of 13.00% to decrease as rates go down. I also expect my income to increase at a reasonable pace. I'm not sure if it's worth mentioning or not but I would like to marry and have children in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

Again, is my math (and logic) correct? Am I completely overlooking something?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!!

I'm thinking of this as having 5 ""levels"" (even though realistically at any one point you could probably use a blend, especially of the first 4 options):  
(1) **Ultra-Low Risk Accounts:** Self-directed, investing pretty much solely in ultra-low/zero risk accounts such as FDIC-insured high-yield savings accounts, CDs, I/Muni Bonds, etc.

(2) **Self-Directed/Index-Fund Based:** Generally focused around investing in the S&amp;P, ETFs and/or mutual funds to diversify and access higher returns that are not necessarily risk free, but are still lower-risk

(3) **Robo-Advisor:** Putting money into Wealthfront, Betterment, etc. and paying an initial management fee - usually around 0.25%

(4) **Financial Advisor:** Still going self-directed and using a combination of strategies, but checking in with a financial advisor for some sort of flat fee to receive professional guidance - this would usually be focused on retirement planning, but not necessarily managing your investments for you.

(5) **Wealth Management:** Full-service professional management with fees ranging from 0.30%-1.00%; generally hands-off by the individual investor. Usually includes some sort of tax-planning service and various specialty services such as executive/equity compensation planning.

For example,   
&lt;$10,000 investable assets - just do #1  
$10,000-50,000 - do #1 and #2  
$50,001-250,000 - do #1, #2, and #3  
$250,001-750,000 - do #1, #2, #3, and #4  
$750,001+ - do #5

Now, these are actually great strategies -- for the last many years, during which I am guessing most of those chattering about all of this started trading or investing.

DCA works great when everything goes up consistently and you can just sit on your money. However, there are many times in history where you would have to take a loss if you invested for many years and then NEEDED that money at a specific time. Sure, if you could have waited, say 10 years, you'd be good, but... I hope you see my point. 

And the charts don't communicate that reality quite as well. The charts just show a drop and then the inevitable rise back, it's easy to gloss over this. I remember hearing folks who invested in this way talk about taking losses for basically all of the first 10 years of the 2000's.

Any way, tl;dr, this all works great, until it doesn't, and most talking about this type of thing haven't really seen anything other than a low interest rate environment. Just go look at a chart of the S&amp;P and ignore the last 10 years for a moment."|0.47|0.0|0.0|0.0|[]

t3_18nphm5|1703172269.0|investing|On Index Investing and Why You Don’t Have To Do It|"The point of this post is not to bash index investing, it’s just to make the argument that index investing is not the only way and it isn’t some perfectly superior one-size-fits-all answer. As a secondary point, I want to put it simply that if you believe there is only one acceptable investing style (active/passive), you are in the wrong.

The existence of passive investing strategies such as index ETFs is, imo, nothing short of a miracle for the average person. It allows folks who don’t know anything about financial markets, valuation, research, or much of anything else, to invest their money safely and successfully over a long term. Indexes, therefore, do a world of good for many people.

On the other hand, when we’re in a sub like this, the people who post and comment are mostly not average people who know nothing about financial markets. A good portion here are doing research regularly (some high-quality and some low-quality, of course) and making active investments based on that research. When they post about it, it’s common for others to come along saying “you should only buy [insert index fund]” or even worse, “you’re stupid for using a money manager”, or the openly hostile “you’re a fraud for being a money manager.” 

They often cite statistics, such as the “Boglehead” studies showing that most money managers don’t beat the market, and almost no active investors beat the market. Here’s why active investors should ignore that statistic:

1. Its methodology is deeply flawed because it can’t account for closet indexers. When I come up with 2-3 companies in every industry and I buy them in roughly equal proportions or I weigh more to bigger industries like tech, what I’m doing is known in the investment industry as **closet indexing**. Closet indexers create portfolios that will be highly correlated with index funds and bear much of the same risk-return profile. Now that’s all well and good, but it is an issue when this is classified under “active investing” and a manager is charging a fee for it. When Bogleheads say a manager like that is underperforming, it isn’t some “gotcha”, all they’re proving is that if you buy what’s essentially an index fund, and you pay a fee above the index fund’s fee, you’re going to underperform. That doesn’t prove there’s something wrong with active investing, it just proves there’s something wrong with closet indexing managers. And this isn’t some tiny portion of managers, it’s extremely common. 

So how do we avoid closet indexers? It’s pretty simple - ask about “**active share**.” Active share is the percentage of a portfolio that exactly matches its benchmark. A [series of studies](https://www.ft.com/content/10a5a37c-a96e-11e3-b87c-00144feab7de) found that most managers with high active share underperform, and most managers with low active share outperform. In other words, if you don’t diversify your portfolio but instead use Buffett’s strategy of building positions in a small number of stocks that you fully understand, you will probably outperform.

2. The statistics don’t apply where Bogleheads want to apply them. What I mean by this is, when they say “most people don’t beat the market,” even if that was true, it isn’t relevant. Whatever active management strategy is currently being discussed is the one that has to beat the market, not all strategies or most strategies. When you say to a value investor “90% of investors don’t beat the market,” they’re never going to change their mind, and they shouldn’t, because you haven’t given them a good reason to. **The question is whether most *value investors*,  (and not just people who call themselves that, by the way) beat the market.** This can be extrapolated to other strategies, of course. Do most day traders beat the market? No, not even close. But most day traders also don’t just say “I trade stock daily,” they have one specific strategy. If you don’t have data on that specific strategy, you probably don’t have relevant data to present at all. Anyone and everyone will always say “yes, but I don’t do things like most people in the statistic you just cited,” and it’s probably true. Research on investing strategies is very hard to conduct, and there definitely isn’t conclusive evidence available that tells us much about most strategies.

3. This idea that nobody can expect to outperform is also just obviously false when faced with common-sense reasoning. This isn’t coming from the same standpoints of statistics or abstract logic, but just practical thinking. If someone works in finance and knows the industry well, talks to industry friends about how their work is going, and reads 10-K’s with that unique insight in mind, you simply aren’t going to convince any reasonable person that the average investor in the market knows more about the industry than this person, because that certainly isn’t true.

None of this is to say that nobody should be investing in indexes. I’d even say *most* people should, because most people don’t want to do the research and spend the time it takes to outperform. 

All I want anyone to take from this is that there’s more than one good way to invest, and if you belittle people for active investing, you’re in the wrong."|0.4|0.0|0.0|0.0|[]
t3_18nmc1t|1703163088.0|investing|I'm a professional money manager and these are some of my notes from premarket 21/12|"  
**What happened yesterday, and my thoughts:**  


* Yesterday, we saw the market start to do a little correction. There wasn’t much news behind the move, except for the fact that VIX options expired, and QQQ failed to break the Call resistance 0DTE at 410. This may have contributed as VIX options had been suppressing VIX till now, and the expiration reset the options positioning a little. As such, VIX moved higher rapidly from 12.5 to 14. For the most part though, this was just normal mean reversion. 
* Markets have been at all time highs, up 16% on SPX since October lows, with 90% of stocks above their 50 day moving average. The market had just become a little too stretched, and needed to breathe. 
* Note that this is of course a very small correction in the scale of the move the market has just done, and is very healthy. Moving indefinitely higher is what’s not healthy. The market has to absorb and digest that move, before moving higher again. In premarket already, we can see the market already start to pare the drop. Over the next few days we will see volume dry up a little going into the Xmas break, and there isn’t much on the economic calendar in the way of major catalysts. With lower volume, we may see markets trade flat, or we can see exacerbated moves in either direction. With little on the economic calendar, it’s hard to guess exactly which way markets will move on a day to day basis. E..g markets are up in premarket, but this can easily fade to retest 4700 at least. On the whole, markets are still stretched despite the 500 point drop on the Dow, but this isn’t to say that today will be red. I caution against making day to day predictions because people call me up if they are in any way wrong. Look, we as investors aren’t fortune tellers, especially when there’s little on the economic calendar to guide us. We can only assess the overall state of the market, to determine risk reward. As readers had noted, I had left my passive positions running (trimmed a bit) and had sold all my active/swing trades, to build cash, because I suspected a near term small correction. I didn’t put the cash into the market yesterday. The dip happened so close to the close that why would I put it in just before, when I have no idea how markets will open tomorrow, especially with little particularly in premarket in way of economic news? The correction, whilst sudden, was still small. So personally, I am waiting to see more before I put the money I had trimmed, back into the market. If it moves higher form here, which premarket points to (although premarket movement means little), I will still be happy as my passive positions make money.   


**My Trades:**  


* (Explaining trades I made in my personal portfolio. People have mentioned rightly not to share too much details about company work, so I have shared trades I was executing in my personal port instead)  

* In terms of what I did yesterday, I explained in yesterday’s post that oil was trading at the top of the downward channel that had been forming. I thought it could easily get rejected there, so I trimmed half my oil positions, and left half running. My price target on oil is 80, so I left some going to meet that, but knew that this could easily get rejected at the top of that channel, so took some out. Technical analysis suggests it can even move lower to 67 now, although you’d have to see a move higher in dollar for that to happen.   

* I also trimmed my enphase position because I was off the desk the day before. Note: I still have some running. I also have positions in FSLR and ARRY. I am bullish on solar still for next year. The reason why I sold some was because I was holding form 80. It was up a lot, and whilst interest rate cuts will help them a lot next year, it doesnt immediately change their near term earnings, which were guided last quarter to be terrible. A 62% move higher in quick time was good enough for me to take some profits here.

**TODAY’S DATA LEDE/MACRO EVENTS:**  


* **UK CBI Trades data:**
   * One of the less important metrics for the Uk, but does give some telling insight, especially because it was such a miss to the downside. Came out -32 vs forecast of -14. It’s a leading indicator of retail performance, so signals a weakening retail sector in UK. (Little impact in GBPUSD because it is a small indicator)  

* **US GDP Final Revision (Q3) - Expected to remain above 5%**  
**PCE revisions too**  
\- note: these are both revisions, and barring a big surprise, won’t move markets too much as should be confirming previous readings.   

* US Jobless Claims  
————  


**INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCH**  


* Evercore says that they see a big pullback in first half of 2024, as recession “materialises”.   

* Goldman put out a piece where they compared the performance of small caps vs large caps in various markets over the last 12 months. There, they concluded that smalls have only outperformed large in emerging markets. Other than it, in Japan, Europe, US and others, they have underperformed large caps. This is something we all mostly knew anyway, since Mag7 led the rally most of the year. I suppose for those that don’t follow other markets, it’s interesting to know this was the case in other markets too.   

* Goldman put out another piece looking at average inflation across G10 economies. They estimated that across them, core inflation ran at just 2.2% over past 3 months and 1.3% in November alone.   

* Hedge funds net long positions on crude hit record low going back to 2011.   

* Fitch says they expect their next moves from the Fed, ECB and BOE to be cuts - no sh\*t Sherlock. No more hikes from here.   

* Interesting fact: Statista shows that international tourism finally reaches pre pandemic level.

**FOREX**  


* GBP was lower yesterday after soft CPI print and continued slightly lower today. Trading 1.265. Note: I hold position in GBPUSD  

* USDJPY continues doing correction as yen moves higher. This is correction after Yen sell off following BOJ dovishness. Note, can bounce off of 142.59. Then again, can not. Depends on initial jobless claims numbers as they can move the dollar.    

* AUD moving higher again.   
————— 

**MARKETS**   


* SPX: Sold off yesterday a bit back to 4700. Held that level in aftermarket, and pared losses to 4722. ( up 0.5% from lows of yesterday)  

* Nasdaq: Fell to 16,550 yesterday, pared some of those losses in premarket, up 0.7% in premarket from the lows.    

* GER40 tracked the sell off in US overnight. Was relatively flat since.   

* HKG: Opened much lower, after US sell off. Recovered 1.6% from there. Basically pushed up right from the open. Partly due to China economic stimulus measure announcements e.g. cutting deposit rate  

* OIL: Failed to break out of downward channel yesterday. Still testing it in premarket. Needs to close above 75 on daily to break out.   

* VIX: pushed up after expiration. Now at 13 handle.   

* Bond yields slightly higher today, probably as sellers take from bonds into equities.

I asked a genuine question and wanted to learn. I hope to get more insights from the more open-minded people here.

Edit: wow guys, I woke up and saw a lot of comments. I appreciate the teaching, constructive reponses a lot. Some comments are weird, some people even sent depression help through DMs. Having never been an RE investor in my life, it's OK it takes pain to learn and I'm glad I got beaten down to fully grasp the concept.

To be clear, I didn't mean RE investment is a bad thing. Nor did I mean RE should replace SP500 entirely. It's another vehicle to diversify your porfolio. I get that.

As I look for efficiency in doing anything in life, the question I should really have asked is, ""Why investing in RE is more efficient than investing in SP500?""

Right after the first few answers last night, I realized I missed a big part of leverage. I fell into the percentage yield trap and did not look under the hood.

The short answer is, **for SP500, to get a 10% return I need 100% ownership of the asset**. On the other hand, in RE, **I do not need 100% ownership of the asset for the appreciation**. If the cashflow is positive, then I should be good. To realize the gain in SP500, I can simply click the sell button, and it is harder to do so in RE.

Mathematically speaking, my equity is an increasing function over time, while the monthly payment is a decreasing function over time, **as long as I'm cashflow positive**. This is the part that puts me into thoughts. It means I have to manage risks such as keeping the job in economy turbulent, managing tenants, dealing with long-ass eviction process if I have to. But I get that, to enjoy the leverage I have to put in the work.

Again, thank you all for all the constructive responses!

Original post below:

\---------------------------------------------------------

Hello,

I'm seeking wisdom from the experts. Every millionaire I know owns a few rental properties. I'm not an RE investor (yet), and I'm trying to justify why I should put my liquid assets into RE, giving there are other options such as investing in SP500.

The SP500 yields more than 150% over the past 10 years with an average of 10% return a year. It also has less stress/risk to manage (a simply google or [here](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042415/what-average-annual-return-sp-500.asp))

I did a simple search for [cities with largest increase in home price](https://constructioncoverage.com/research/cities-with-the-largest-home-price-growth-last-decade) and found that unless you pick the right cities to buy homes in, you will not beat the SP500. Problem is, then you have to manage the property remotely or have your property manager do so which decreases the yield even more. Owning investment properties also comes with finding tenants at times, managing them, dealing with evictions etc.

Money invested in SP500 is liquid, which is not the case with homes.

Based on some of these facts, I'm not super convinced that putting my liquid assets into home, unless I can find homes that appreciates in value of more than 10%/year, in the right city, at the right time. Is this how people do it?

Last year I have 6000USD of tax loss carried over into this.

So far, my portfolio has realized gains and losses.  I can just sell stocks/bonds for $6000 profit tax free due to being offset by the losses right?  Since my bank doesn't charge transaction fees, I am thinking about just selling them to turn unrealized gains into realized gains and buy them right back.  

The confusing part of it all is the deal related to long term vs short term.  Because my 6000USD tax loss comes from bonds which I held for more than 6 months, so to cancel those out, my profit has to be long term capital gains?"|0.5|0.0|0.0|0.0|[]
t3_18ncwvv|1703128379.0|investing|Why Did the Market Sell-Off?|"At 1:30pm ET today, SPY hit $475.73 and decisively broke downwards for the day. At 2:05pm ET, it fell below yesterday's close at $474.84, from there it waterfalled all the way to $468.26.

This was a major and abrupt 1.5% slide from the highs of the day.

# Why did it sell off?

First of all, it's without a doubt that the stock market has been overheated for a while now. SPY is hitting all-time-highs, other indices are hitting resistance, fintech stocks are pumping to Mars. In some ways, it feels like we're back in 2020-2021.

However, it's important to note that an overheated market is not a reason to sell. ATHs are often bullish signals, else the indices wouldn't be where we are today.While the exact reason of the sell-off can't be known by us outsiders, there are reasonable speculations. A major one is the selling of 1 million open SPY $475 call options that triggered the sell-off of the index. This sudden spike in selling pressure triggered a cascade of selling as 0-dte options gamblers cut losses and institutions bailed from the market.

This is just one speculation, but a plausible one and backed by market data.

However, we also have to give credit to a negative macroeconomic backdrop. The closing off of the Suez Canal for global shipping due to Houthi aggression in the Red Sea is alarming for inflation. Ships have to divert a long distance around the horn of Africa, significantly increasing time and cost to final destination. Add to this the poor Fedex earnings report from yesterday in which the stock fell over 10%, as well as the already significantly overheated markets, and it's clear there's a growing wall of anxiety in the market. No wonder all it took is a spike in selling for the market to sell off in a big way.Hindsight is 20/20 but that doesn't mean we can't learn from the past.

# So what happens next?

You can be in one of two camps from here. One camp thinks this is a healthy bull market pullback and we'll consolidate around here or below before rocketing back up again.

The second camp thinks that the market is yet to appreciate the full effects of the closing of the Suez Canal, as well as the economic canary in the coal mine from Fedex's earnings report, and this is the start of another major pullback.

The prudent thing to do is to reduce risk, monitor the market and the geopolitical situation, then decide your next move. The situation right now is unknown and highly dynamic and any big bets at this point is premature.

If I had to pick a side, I think this is just a healthy bull market pullback."|0.68|155.0|0.0|155.0|['the Suez Canal for global', 'Fedex', 'SPY']

I want to open a discussion about the future of AI in the investment world and I'd love to get your thoughts on a specific aspect.  
  
As we are seeing more and more AI driven tools for investment, here's the dilemma:  
  
**Build Your Own AI Model:** This option allows investors to create and fine-tune their own AI models. It's all about personalization, where you get to decide the factors, markets, and risk levels that the AI should consider. It's a bit like crafting your own investment strategy, but with a techy, AI-driven twist.  
  
**Use a Premade AI Model:** This is the plug-and-play option. An AI model that's already been built and trained, ready for you to use. All you need to do is invest based on the model’s recommendations. It’s simpler, but with less flexibility and personal input.  
  
Would you guys be more inclined to build your own AI model, tailoring it to your specific investment philosophy?  
Or, would you prefer the convenience and ease of a premade AI model, even if it means less customization?

somebody tell me why i’m wrong. there has to be a reason more people dont pile into TQQQ but do pile into QQQ to hold for longterm. is it just risk appetite and they dont want to deal with 3x downturns? im 23 so i still have plenty of time to be able to afford high risk so i would be okay with 3x downturns assuming im not missing something big here."|0.77|60.0|0.0|60.0|['QQQ', 'TQQQ']

The market maker pays the broker for this privilege, which typically allows the broker to operate without trade commissions. But the bid-ask spread basically acts like an indirect commission (albeit small) since the buyer is paying slightly more than the true price.

The information I haven't been able to find is:

* What is the effective average 'cost' of PFOF?
* Are ETFs included in PFOF and also have an effective cost to trade?
* Is there a limit to the effective cost of PFOF? Can the effective cost change/surge unexpectedly to much higher levels than normal?
* Which brokerage firms engage in PFOF? Are there any that do not?
* Is there a good way of avoiding/boycotting the PFOF system?
* If PFOF is banned, what would happen to brokers whose business models rely on PFOF? Is there any risk for investors given SIPC protection?

The reason why I want to know this information is I am finally ditching Northwestern Mutual in favor of low cost trading somewhere else. I am attracted to Robinhood because of the IRA 1-3% contribution match (and no commissions), but am starting to learn about the ugly truth of PFOF.

I once hired him to do a fairly simple project that shouldn't take more than 30 man hours.

Now he owns half a construction company. I doubt he has ever actually hammered a single nail himself but he seems to be pretty good at directing his employees and the work the've done looks good.

This past year, I experimented with putting that chunk of money in a Fidelity account instead of the HYSA and every time I accrued more than $1000, I bought a CD or treasury that was scheduled to expire before Jan 31 of the next year.

I believe I averaged better than if I had used a HYSA, but I also fully admit this is more “work” than if I had just left it all in the HYSA or something like SPAXX. Having said that, it takes ten minutes once a month to review the account and grab whatever the best yield is and lock it in.

Over my entire career (probably another 20-25 years), I intend to leave any excess returns in the account in the hopes my excess returns can cover the increases to my taxes and insurance due to inflation, eliminating any need to increase how much I have to deposit per paycheck. 

Are there any holes or blind spots I’m missing in this strategy other than the minimal amount of work required that you guys can think of?"|0.69|6.0|0.0|6.0|['SPAXX']

I, like many others, realized capital losses last year in excess of what I am allowed to claim. So I can use $3k of last year's capital losses to offset gains from this year. As it's approaching end of year, I want to make sure I do this wisely.

I have realized long-term and short-term capital gains this year in excess of $3,000. I also have unrealized long term and short term capital losses in excess of those amounts I could use this year.

Because long-term gains are more tax friendly than short-term gains, I want to ensure the $3k of losses I roll over to this year are used to cancel out short-term gains. Does anyone know if this will automatically happen, if I am able to designate this, or if they will automatically cancel out the long term gains?

*Apr 10, 2023*  
*The bust of the stock market bubble will only be halfway over when the Federal Reserve starts cutting interest rates, according to GMO founder Jeremy Grantham. He expects that to happen in late 2024.*  


*The legendary investor — who's made his name predicting market crashes across multiple decades — predicts even more gloom ahead in the market. Previously, Grantham said stocks were in the ""final phase"" before crashing, and asset prices that ballooned in recent years could soon pop as the economy risks facing a steep recession.*

  
*Though some investors are looking for signs of the next bull market, that's the wrong way to think about stocks in the current environment, Grantham said. ""Great Bubbles"" in the stock market are different from typical bull and bear markets, meaning it's likely there's another round of pain ahead.*  


*""Most of the decline in these great bear markets only happens after the first interest rate cut. So you tell me when the first interest rate cut is, and I will tell you when the second half of the pain is going to start,"" Grantham said in an interview with The Investor's Podcast on Friday.*

It’s all about active management   
  
A common theme across 2024 outlooks is that investors will do well to actively manage their portfolios next year. That’s a bit different than the ‘set it and forget it’ long-run investment advice that typically prevails among portfolio managers.  
  
Stocks and bonds have been unusually volatile this year, behaving in ways that aren’t consistent with economic expectations, wrote Jack Manley, global market strategist at JPMorgan. Given those “significant dislocations,” he said “simply owning the indices will not suffice.”  
  
That means an investment strategy that relies on broad market movements to generate returns, rather than on specific stock selection or other active management strategies, may fall short.  
  
“Investors need to take a more active approach to their portfolios. This is not a time to switch on the investing autopilot; it’s a time to take the controls,” wrote analysts at BlackRock. “It’s important to be deliberate in taking portfolio risk, in our view, and we expect to deploy more risk over the next year.”"|0.73|19.0|0.0|19.0|['CNN', 'JPMorgan', 'BlackRock', 'https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/19/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/19/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html']

Have had this on my watchlist for a while and recently bought 100 stocks. I have some more cash and was wondering if investing more makes sense or not. Below is my reasoning for MBG.

- current price: ~63
- 52 week high: ~76
- 52 week low: ~55
- dividend yield: ~8%
- P/E: 4.5 (5 year average ~11)

Now looking at financials:

Revenue growth 5Y: -1.8%.
Gross margin: 22.8% with 5 year avg of 20.8%
Operating margin: 12% with 5 year avg of 7.2%
Net profit margin: 10% with 5 year avg of 5.6%

Though revenues have stagnated in last 5 years, they are expected to grow revenues to 165 billion euros by 2027. Improving margins should strongly boost their bottom line.

Free cash flow generated over last 5 years is about 28 billion ( annual  avg of about 5.6 billion). In 9 months in 2023 itself , free cash flow is about 5 billion euros.

Conclusion:

Considering that EU will protect its automobile industry from cheap Chinese cars, and MBG has a strong footing in luxury cars, I feel that this stock is a strong buy. Given inflation and recessionary outlook, growth is limited in the short term but they are improving their fundamentals and margins. Over last 3 years, they have generated strong and healthy cash flows and the 8% dividend is cherry on top."|0.58|2.0|0.0|2.0|['MBG', 'EU']

I like having the VOO in there for steady reliable growth so that’s why that’s at 20%. And when looking at the top companies (right now) within the S&amp;P 500 they are mostly tech. I honestly don’t see these companies disappearing off the map like a lot of tech companies did back in the internet boom. I think they have secured a foothold to be around for a good while. That being said that’s why I allocated another 20% in VGT which focuses and has higher weights on these top tech companies (see second photo which shows weights on companies in S&amp;P 500 and how tech dominates the top 20 or so). To balance out the rest of the portfolio I have both SCHD and SCHG.

Obviously an emergency fund and getting an employers 401K match would be a priority, but after that, it seems hard to beat a guaranteed tax-free ""return"" of 7%.

I ask because we bought a smaller house before the market went nuts and had two kids since, and realized the schools we're zoned for are pretty awful, plus we'd like a bigger house now that we have kids. We thought we were being financially smart by purchasing a smaller house than we could afford. We got what we needed at the time, assuming we'd be able to upgrade, if needed. But now we're kinda screwed and are going to have almost 3x the mortgage rate if we move. Investing made sense when the house loan was cheap, but if we do decide to move, I feel like I'd just need to throw money at the new house until it was fully paid off.

Also, what's the consensus on what to do if you currently have a low-interest loan house, but need/want to move. Keep it and rent it out, while taking out a larger mortgage on the new house, or sell it so you can put more money towards the new house and have a lower high-interest rate mortgage?

Maybe it's not possible. I'm interested in what you think is the best option but also in the range of options available, and any substitutes that I might be missing.

For example, let's say we have a bank account and we want to keep $1000 in it. At the end of each month, it will have between $500 and $2000 in it. At that point, f there's anything above that $1000, we want to move it automatically into a money market mutual fund or similar place.

E-Trade is the brokerage handling employee shares for VMware, and consequently the distribution of shares + cash after the deal closed.

I had elected 100% share conversions to AVGO for my 4.5 years of ESPP and vested RSU. More shares vested after the initial election, and I elected them to be converted to 100% AVGO as well.

The acquisition deal closed end of November, the payout ratio was determined as 52% share conversion to AVGO and 48% cash. Instead of honoring the stock conversion ratio that was decided, all my shares have been cashed out by E-Trade. We know of at least 55 confirmed employees affected by this issue, and about 100-150 have indicated they might have been affected.

I happen to have screenshots of my elections.

E-Trade has been telling inconsistent stories to the affected people. Primarily, that we needed to elect the entirety of the original election again while making the second election, because the second election overwrote the first election. Which I have proof of that there was no option to do so. The second election only allowed the newly vested shares to be elected, and after the election, as per the screenshot and their UI, the quantity of shares remaining to choose election was 0. The folks who were not affected by this issue only made elections for the newly vested shares as well.

E-Trade has been dismissing everyone who's been calling them, and we've been doing that almost daily. They are saying they cannot do anything. They haven't yet officially closed the complaint we have written to them.

At an individual level,

1. It's an outright value loss of \~$52/share based on the effective share price at the payout ratio of 52:48. That amounts to tens of thousands of dollars for me.
2. I have to pay more taxes now for all the liquid cash.
3. The value of AVGO has skyrocketed since the deal close. I lose all those gains.
4. Even if I were to buy AVGO now, my cost basis is reset to current price, vs earning them at a lower price from 4.5 years of hard work.
5. I don't get dividend payouts that AVGO is excellent for.

Has anyone experienced such an issue with E-Trade or any brokerage during an acquisition? Any suggestions on how to navigate this would be greatly appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: E-Trade made an error for stock conversion from VMW to AVGO, for several employees, which resulted in tens of thousands of dollars of losses for me. And they are not willing to do anything about it."|0.6|1.0|0.0|1.0|['E-Trade', 'VMW', 'ESPP', 'RSU', 'VMware', 'AVGO']

And that buying it is one of the smartest things you can do. Well, all of that is just cheap propaganda. A bait to lure you to buy something worthless.

Bitcoins have no intrinsic value. When you buy them, you only get a short record, e.g. '5.1234 BTC'.

If someone issued a record and offered it to the public, they must redeem it. The record has to have redemption value. Casino chips, fiat currencies, shares, or gift cards are examples of such records. When you hold them, all you can see is a short string of characters written on digital, plastic or paper media. There is nothing intrinsically valuable to utilize. That's why their issuers must redeem them for something.

Casinos redeem issued chips for cash. Banks redeem issued currencies for debt servicing and liens release. Namely, units of fiat currencies are issued as debt owed to banks - individuals and companies owe it to commercial banks based on loans, while governments owe it to central banks based on bonds. That's why the banks redeem deposits and banknotes for reducing or closing that debt and releasing liens on the property that secures it. Corporations, if they decide to end their business operations, redeem issued shares for funds from liquidated assets. Finally, retailers redeem issued gift cards for goods or services.

On the other hand, Satoshi Nakamoto, as the issuer of bitcoin record, does not redeem it. He issues it through the protocol he wrote but never redeems from anyone. If you invested electricity to make his system work and got bitcoins for it, Nakamoto won't redeem them even for a dime. Everyone who holds bitcoins knows this. They know that bitcoins have neither redemption nor intrinsic value. They know that bitcoins are worthless. That is why they are forced to get rid of them, sell them to someone. And to do this successfully, they must publicly promote Bitcoin as valuable. They must compare it to gold, diamonds or artwork. They must say it is the superior version of fiat currencies or money in general. That it can save us from greedy banks. That it is revolutionary like the Internet. That it is scarce. That it solves corruption and financial problems. That it can lift poor countries out of poverty. They need to sugarcoat Bitcoin.

All these stories are of course ridiculous. They would be such even if bitcoins were units of equity, like shares or units of debt, like fiat currencies. But bitcoins are units of the number 21 million. Nakamoto came up with it in his imagination, after which he wrote a protocol that assigns its units to online addresses and stores them in a decentralized database.

Numbers, whether they are stored centrally or decentrally, don't have magical powers. They cannot solve corruption, play the role of artwork or precious metals, lift countries out of poverty, save us from banks, or be scarce. They cannot be money if they are unredeemable because there's nothing to compare with the value of goods and services. Those who claim the opposite, know very well this is ridiculous. But they do it out of necessity. They invested huge amounts of redeemable records or intrinsically valuable items into the scheme and must get them back. On the one hand, they don't want to be the bag holders. On the other hand, they want to profit from the scheme as much as possible.

I have traditionally stayed away from these types of funds based on the logic that the management fees are not worth whatever benefit they may offer trying to “beat the market”.

However, the presented pitch was that this fund is not attempting to beat the market on straight returns, but is instead aiming to provide maximum returns through a reduced tax strategy based on strategic buying and selling of stock. The fund data I have reviewed from fidelity shows a return about 1% higher than benchmark after management fees (the fee is .4%). This was over the 14 year lifetime of the fund which was started in 2010.

Does anyone have any experience investing in this fund? Any thoughts on the pros or cons of investing in this type of fund?

# 10% - The price you pay

Key take away is that ""A PART OF ALL YOU EARN IS YOURS TO KEEP"". And precisely it is 10%. 10% of your income is yours to keep where you will employ that money to make money for yourself consistently.

We can argue that we are not able to make meets end, needs are growing with increasing/stuck income. If you are not in debt and still you got to complain about 10% then there is something that needs to be sorted out because if you want to be wealthy, you have to pay yourself first. And that is 10% of what you make.

""Live below your means"". That t-shirt can wait. Maybe that trip can wait. All these can wait until you pay yourself 10% first.

Note that you won't become too wealthy from it. Compounding returns will need time. Much more time. To live by this thought, look up to Warren Buffet who got his &gt; 90% of networth after he was 50 years. It took him a long time, from 10 years old to 50 years old to have this crazy compounding.

# Advice on getting advice

Second emphasis that I have noted in book is ""taking advice from wise people who knows how to manage and multiply money"".

This is so true in our time because there are lots and lots of scammers who lure you in for hefty profits &amp; once you are trapped, your money is gone.

Finding wise people is as hard as making profits in derivatives market where 95% people took loss and remaining 5%'s profit had 15-50% of transaction fees.

But looking back and retrace the path that ""wise"" people have taken throughout their lifetime is beneficial and that ""looking back and learning from that"" is nothing but ""learning from their success &amp; failures""

# Conclusion

Although there ARE many learnings which I have missed but I have shared what I relate most.

Personally I was only saving 3-4% of my income by excusing myself about the ""needs"" that I have to fullfill. But after reading this, I have pledged my 10% income to be mine and only mine which would go to investments in several mechanisms.

And another measure that I have taken is to educate myself from the wise. Reading about investors, their strategies and watching courses.

I would be back with my personal learnings on ""The Psychology of Money"" once I am ready."|0.45|0.0|0.0|0.0|[]

If true then it seems the 529 could be treated like a HSA. You leave it in, let it grow, and only withdraw later with your saved college expense receipts. If you have money left over you can pass it down to your kids.

Is anyone aware of this or was I misinformed?

Update: thanks all for your comments - it seems I was misinformed. Additional point here:   


When it comes to 529 plan withdrawals, it's essential to align the timing of the distributions with the year in which the qualifying educational expenses are incurred. This requirement isn't explicitly stated as an IRS rule, but it is strongly implied by published IRS guidance and agreed upon by tax professionals.  
  
The rationale behind this timing alignment is to prevent potential misuse of 529 plans. For example, if funds in a 529 plan are allowed to grow tax-deferred over an extended period and then withdrawn to pay for expenses incurred in a previous year, it could lead to financial benefits that the plan isn't designed to provide. This practice could potentially be seen as an abuse of the tax advantages of 529 plans."|0.73|5.0|0.0|5.0|['ESA', 'Update', 'IRS', 'HSA']

People will often say the dollar retains hegemony as the worlds reserve currency because of things like it is backed by the US military, that it is the most stable, that US citizens and residents need it to pay taxes, and while I think there is truth to all these points, I think the real reason the US dollar has retained hegemony is by virtue of the fact you can't invest in US equities without dollars. 

This goes for international investors, but the real driving force is the domestic market. Whenever the money supply expands due to monetary policy from the central bank, or a commercials bank issuing a loan, one way or another, that money after being taxed several times, transacted several times, eventually finds its way to the equities market. 

Unlike other countries where if their money supply expands, the money is primarily spent on consumer goods and services. 

So this means that the more vibrant a countries' equity market is, the less likely it is to experience inflation even if it has stimulative monetary policy.

I've come across intriguing content on YouTube and various platforms that proposes a financial strategy involving the use of a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) to both cover living expenses and accelerate the repayment of a mortgage. While this approach seems unconventional and potentially rewarding, it also raises red flags regarding its inherent risks and potential complications.

As investors, we are accustomed to assessing risk and reward in various financial endeavors. The notion of relying on a HELOC to sustain one's lifestyle while simultaneously paying down a mortgage faster appears to be a high-stakes maneuver. I'm keen to delve into the experiences of this community to gain a deeper understanding of the practicalities and challenges associated with such a strategy.

For those who have explored or implemented this financial approach, could you share your insights? What were the tangible outcomes, both positive and negative?

It’s the newest phase of the “junk” debt revolution that started in the bond market with Michael Milken in the 1980s, spread to syndicated loans in the 1990s and turned the market loose on the staid business of lending. The history of leveraged debt is the history of the modern financialized US company—one worth revisiting as private credit kicks into high gear.

t3_18jv5lx|1702745223.0|investing|Best strategy for minimizing risk|"Basically my father is an investor in a private REIT going public soon and he has the standard 6 month lockup on his OP units. I’m 17 years old but plan on going into finance and know a lot about investing.

My idea to hedge the risk was a standard ATM cost-less/slight cost collar strategy assuming the bump up on his shares at IPO is favorable, probably in the 15%-30% range is ideal, I’ll be looking more into the S-10 when its released to see their property portfolio and do a proper valuation and due diligence, but he wants to sell anyway as he doesn’t really need the income considering his age.

My question is, in order to minimize as much downside risk, is there really any better option than a collar strategy? I mean he could short a subset of peers in the same REIT sector if the bump up on IPO is insignificant, but I don’t think he wants to do an L/S strategy here considering possible dislocation between the sides of the trade due to IPO volatility and general market qualms."|0.5|0.0|0.0|0.0|['ATM', 'IPO']
t3_18jv3rx|1702745077.0|investing|This is what I have been talking about here for awhile|"Too much diversification does not make sense! with that said it’s good to be properly diversified but criticizing investing on sector specific ETFs is wrong.

Everyone always says that just buying the market is the best thing if you don’t know what you are doing and while that is true it also hinders your growth.

My way of thinking is that based on how young and how risk adverse you are you should calculate how much diversification you need.

For myself since I am still very young I decided to go with VT 60% and VGT 40%.

Fired my FA several years ago and have unwound the vast majority of high cost investments and reallocated all into low cost broad based index funds.  I still have about $60k remaining in private REITS that are highly illiquid.  One REIT (~$26k) is now offering liquidity but at a 20% discount to the current NAV.  I struggle with taking the 20% haircut but I’m leaning toward liquidating and just moving to VTSAX and moving along with life.
