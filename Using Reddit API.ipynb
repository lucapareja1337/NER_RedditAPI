If the stock's *real* value (as determined by varying criteria such as quarterly earnings or P/E and the like) is lower than its current price then we know we should buy the stock and then sell it when that *real* value matches or exceeds the current market price.\\n\\nIf my understanding is correct, I don't see how this strategy could ever work. Here's why:\\n\\n**Option 1:** All investors use the same criteria to determine *real* value. If everyone is using the same criteria as you are then they will see that the stock is undervalued just like you would see and so they would invest (likely before you get a chance to) and bring the current price up to its *real* price. This would mean that all stocks are constantly accurately valued and that all *real* prices match current prices. Thus fundamental analysis would provide no benefit to an investor.\\n\\n**Option 2:** All investors use different criteria to determine *real* value. If everyone uses different criteria to determine *real* value of a stock then you might know that a stock is undervalued before almost anybody else since you selected the *correct* criteria while others used *incorrect* criteria. The issue is that even if you know that a stock is undervalued by your own criteria, if nobody else knows this (since they used other criteria from you) then the stock's price will not increase. If the price doesn't increase it will remain at its current price even though you know that it's *real* price is higher. Thus in this case as well, fundamental analysis would provide no benefit to an investor.\\n\\n**Potential but problematic answer**: The only way fundamental analysis could benefit an investor that I can think of, is if people use different criteria (option 2) and some use objectively correct criteria for determining the *real* price of a stock. If only some investors are using the *correct* methods and others buy the stock for no reason (or at least not based on *correct* fundamental analysis that somehow still led them to buy the same stock but later than the original investors) then the stock price would rise and the original investors would benefit. But if there are objective criteria for predicting stocks, how have they not been fully discovered and adopted by all major investors? That is, if there is a way to 'see through the matrix' and evaluate stocks in a consistently successful manner that is nonobvious to other investors, it would certainly become the most common way to evaluate a stock, thereby rendering it fully ineffective. For this problematic answer to be true there would need to be a *correct* list of criteria relevant for evaluating stocks that is either kept highly secret or that is known but that is ignored by most investors. Both these seem highly unlikely to me.\\n\\nAny answer to this puzzle that is better than my problematic answer would be greatly appreciated.

Retirement savings?)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors? Any other assets?)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Any big debts (include interest rate) or expenses?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;And any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Please consider consulting our FAQ first - &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/wiki/faq\"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/wiki/faq&lt;/a&gt;\\nAnd our &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/about/sidebar\"&gt;side bar&lt;/a&gt; also has useful resources.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;If you are new to investing - please refer to Wiki - &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/wiki/index/gettingstarted/\"&gt;Getting Started&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The reading list in the wiki has a list of books ranging from light reading to advanced topics depending on your knowledge level.

Thanks in advance!&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;edit: for clarification, I already initiated the roll over from the 401k to RH and checks were cut, currently being mailed to RH.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n","     'likes': None,\n","     'suggested_sort': None,\n","     'banned_at_utc': None,\n","     'view_count': None,\n","     'archived': False,\n","     'no_follow': False,\n","     'is_crosspostable': True,\n","     'pinned': False,\n","     'over_18': False,\n","     'all_awardings': [],\n","     'awarders': [],\n","     'media_only': False,\n","     'can_gild': False,\n","     'spoiler': False,\n","     'locked': False,\n","     'author_flair_text': None,\n","     'treatment_tags': [],\n","     'visited': False,\n","     'removed_by': None,\n","     'num_reports': None,\n","     'distinguished': None,\n","     'subreddit_id': 't5_2qhhq',\n","     'author_is_blocked': False,\n","     'mod_reason_by': None,\n","     'removal_reason': None,\n","     'link_flair_background_color': '',\n","     'id': '195wfiu',\n","     'is_robot_indexable': True,\n","     'report_reasons': None,\n","     'author': 'MagnumWhine',\n","     'discussion_type': None,\n","     'num_comments': 12,\n","     'send_replies': True,\n","     'whitelist_status': 'all_ads',\n","     'contest_mode': False,\n","     'mod_reports': [],\n","     'author_patreon_flair': False,\n","     'author_flair_text_color': None,\n","     'permalink': '/r/investing/comments/195wfiu/i_think_i_messed_up_backdoor_roth/',\n","     'parent_whitelist_status': 'all_ads',\n","     'stickied': False,\n","     'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/195wfiu/i_think_i_messed_up_backdoor_roth/',\n","     'subreddit_subscribers': 2497325,\n","     'created_utc': 1705175400.0,\n","     'num_crossposts': 2,\n","     'media': None,\n","     'is_video': False}},\n","   {'kind': 't3',\n","    'data': {'approved_at_utc': None,\n","     'subreddit': 'investing',\n","     'selftext': \"Is there some concrete comparison of the performance of the stock picking individual investors vs hedge funds.\\n\\nMany of the articles I see say that SP500 etc beats more than 90% of the hedge funds in the long term.

Automotive, Omniverse, Software services are their next mulit-billion$ opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;NVDA is a freight train that will not be impeded.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n","     'likes': None,\n","     'suggested_sort': None,\n","     'banned_at_utc': None,\n","     'view_count': None,\n","     'archived': False,\n","     'no_follow': False,\n","     'is_crosspostable': True,\n","     'pinned': False,\n","     'over_18': False,\n","     'all_awardings': [],\n","     'awarders': [],\n","     'media_only': False,\n","     'can_gild': False,\n","     'spoiler': False,\n","     'locked': False,\n","     'author_flair_text': None,\n","     'treatment_tags': [],\n","     'visited': False,\n","     'removed_by': None,\n","     'num_reports': None,\n","     'distinguished': None,\n","     'subreddit_id': 't5_2qhhq',\n","     'author_is_blocked': False,\n","     'mod_reason_by': None,\n","     'removal_reason': None,\n","     'link_flair_background_color': '',\n","     'id': '195vuei',\n","     'is_robot_indexable': True,\n","     'report_reasons': None,\n","     'author': 'norcalnatv',\n","     'discussion_type': None,\n","     'num_comments': 13,\n","     'send_replies': True,\n","     'whitelist_status': 'all_ads',\n","     'contest_mode': False,\n","     'mod_reports': [],\n","     'author_patreon_flair': False,\n","     'author_flair_text_color': None,\n","     'permalink': '/r/investing/comments/195vuei/nvda_data_center_growth_model_history_and/',\n","     'parent_whitelist_status': 'all_ads',\n","     'stickied': False,\n","     'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/195vuei/nvda_data_center_growth_model_history_and/',\n","     'subreddit_subscribers': 2497325,\n","     'created_utc': 1705173874.0,\n","     'num_crossposts': 1,\n","     'media': None,\n","     'is_video': False}},\n","   {'kind': 't3',\n","    'data': {'approved_at_utc': None,\n","     'subreddit': 'investing',\n","     'selftext': 'Hi\\n\\nJust looking for some help in understanding how dividends are paid in life strategy 100.

Did you create money by doing so? Namely, when we look at what is today called money (euros, dollars, pounds), it is just paper with numbers. The same applies to deposits in banks. They are numbers - it is just they are not on paper but on a digital medium. So, do you create money by writing a number on a paper? Of course not. The idea that money is created by just putting numbers on paper or digital media is a popular myth.\\n\\r\\nFor numbers to be money, they must be redeemable. What does that mean? Let\\'s say that your paper with the number 100 is a security that entitles the bearer to 100 kg of wheat. You are actually a farmer and have issued a paper with the number 100 indicating a specific amount of wheat that you will give to whoever brings that paper. That means that the number 100 is redeemable. That it has redemption value. You as the issuer of the number took the liability. By taking liability you gave value to that number. As such, the number can be money because based on the size of that liability it can be determined how much goods and services are worth giving for it.\\n\\r\\nEuros, dollars or pounds work similarly. They are indeed numbers, but redeemable numbers. They have redemption value. Their issuers - commercial and central banks redeem them for debt servicing and liens release. This is because these numbers are issued as debt. Individuals and companies owe it to commercial banks based on loans, while governments owe it to central banks based on bonds. That is why banks have the liability to redeem these numbers, which is clearly shown in their accounting books. They have liability to redeem them for reducing or closing the said debt and releasing liens on the property that secures it. So, if an individual can remove a lien from a car title by giving the number 20,000 to the bank that issued it, the value of that number is somewhere in the range of the car\\'s value. And that\\'s why that number is money. Based on the size of the liability behind it we can determine how much goods and services are worth giving for it.\\n\\r\\nNow we finally come to cryptocurrencies. They are said to be money. Given the above, let\\'s see if this is true. When you buy a cryptocurrency, all you receive is a number next to the name of that cryptocurrency. For example \\'5.4321\\' BTC. But is that number redeemable by its issuer? Does it have redemption value? Has its issuer took the liability to redeem it for something? In the case of Bitcoin, the issuer is Satoshi Nakamoto. Has he took the liability to redeem the units and sub-units of the number 21 million that he issues through the protocol he authored? Well, no. He took no such liability. His numbers have no redemption value. That\\'s why is impossible to determined how much goods and services are worth giving for them. Or to put it simply, they are not money.\\n\\r\\nThere is a well-known example of the pizzeria owner who gave two pizzas for the number 10,000. Why did he accept that number and not 1, 1,000 or 100,000? Well, there is no rational reason. He did that blindly. He had no redemption value as a reference to determine whether or not it was worth giving two pizzas for a specific number, which is why he accepted 10,000 completely arbitrarily.\\n\\r\\nSo what Satoshi Nakamoto came up with and what various cryptocurrency authors are copying are not payment or monetary systems. Instead, they are investment pyramids. They attract participants by misrepresenting non-redeemable numbers as money. Also, they are wrapped in cellophane of cryptography and decentralization, which gives them the appearance of seriousness.\\n\\r\\nThe whole thing works in the following way. A crypto author uses their imagination to come up with a number - 21 million in the case of Bitcoin. Then, they simply write a protocol that attributes units and subunits of that number to addresses of users that maintain the system. Numbers are cryptographically protected and stored in a decentralized database. Other users then register into the system and exchange the numbers thinking they are making \"secure online payments\". They think they are part of a modern payment system, that they are \"using money\". But in reality, they just participate in the modern investment pyramid. Cryptocurrencies are pyramid schemes where participants pay in redeemable numbers (EUR, USD, GBP...), goods, or services and in return they get non-redeemable numbers (BTC, ETH, DODGE...). Due to the lack of redemption value, if the payments into the schemes stop, everything collapses and the participants are left with nothing. Just as this is the case with all investment pyramids.',\n","     'author_fullname': 't2_dg2i7htt7',\n","     'saved': False,\n","     'mod_reason_title': None,\n","     'gilded': 0,\n","     'clicked': False,\n","     'title': 'Why cryptocurrencies are actually investment pyramids',\n","     'link_flair_richtext': [],\n","     'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/investing',\n","     'hidden': False,\n","     'pwls': 6,\n","     'link_flair_css_class': None,\n","     'downs': 0,\n","     'top_awarded_type': None,\n","     'hide_score': False,\n","     'name': 't3_195p887',\n","     'quarantine': False,\n","     'link_flair_text_color': 'dark',\n","     'upvote_ratio': 0.36,\n","     'author_flair_background_color': None,\n","     'subreddit_type': 'public',\n","     'ups': 0,\n","     'total_awards_received': 0,\n","     'media_embed': {},\n","     'author_flair_template_id': None,\n","     'is_original_content': False,\n","     'user_reports': [],\n","     'secure_media': None,\n","     'is_reddit_media_domain': False,\n","     'is_meta': False,\n","     'category': None,\n","     'secure_media_embed': {},\n","     'link_flair_text': None,\n","     'can_mod_post': False,\n","     'score': 0,\n","     'approved_by': None,\n","     'is_created_from_ads_ui': False,\n","     'author_premium': False,\n","     'thumbnail': '',\n","     'edited': 1705328341.0,\n","     'author_flair_css_class': None,\n","     'author_flair_richtext': [],\n","     'gildings': {},\n","     'content_categories': None,\n","     'is_self': True,\n","     'mod_note': None,\n","     'created': 1705156287.0,\n","     'link_flair_type': 'text',\n","     'wls': 6,\n","     'removed_by_category': None,\n","     'banned_by': None,\n","     'author_flair_type': 'text',\n","     'domain': 'self.investing',\n","     'allow_live_comments': False,\n","     'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suppose you write the number 100 on a piece of paper.

I am Brazilian, 36 years old, a marketer with an MBA in marketing and branding. In 2020, I owned two barbershops in my city, with an annual turnover of approximately 350k USD. Like many others, we had to close during the pandemic, and I found myself newly married and without income. I tried to think of various new businesses, played online poker, battled depression, and in the midst of it all, I saw an opportunity: investing in art.\\n\\nArt has always been a passion in my life. My mother, who had me at 16, had her first degree in Fine Arts. So, when she had no one to leave me with, she took me to her art classes. I have many tattoos and a great appreciation for surrealism and Salvador Dalí. I even have his face tattooed on my left arm and the elephant with thin legs on my leg.\\n\\nMy original idea was to create a hybrid gallery (a marketplace and host exhibitions in non-traditional venues like restaurants, stores, and even my own barbershop). I started collecting various artists with this strategy in mind and held my first exhibition in the barbershop, but it resulted in zero sales. Three exhibitions in a friend\\'s home decor store and another in a restaurant also resulted in no sales. I needed to learn from this—either my artworks didn\\'t work, or I was in the wrong place.\\n\\nDuring this journey, I pursued a new specialization in Art Business and learned more about how the art market operates. Brazil, being a third-world country with a significantly deflated currency compared to the dollar and euro (1 USD = approximately 4.85 Brazilian Reais), led me to a new theory: buy in Reais and sell in a strong currency. For this, I needed a truly unique product that would attract collectors worldwide.\\n\\nAmong the artists I started buying from, one stood out. This artist had over a million followers on social media and ticked all the validation points—mastery of technique, academic refinement, authentic work, and most importantly, customers! This artist released serialized sculptures (50 to 70 units per edition), and the prices increased with each sold-out batch, ranging from 200 USD to 1.5k USD in a matter of weeks. My mind exploded when I saw this. I seized the opportunity and bought three sculptures, two from the first batch and one from the second.\\n\\nOver time, I observed the artist\\'s creative process—creating a drawing, transforming it into a painting and/or sculpture. I concluded that if the serialized sculptures appreciated so quickly, why wouldn\\'t the paintings that inspired them be equally valuable? It involved a higher investment, but the returns could be exponentially greater. All of his paintings were oil-based, taking months to complete and were unique.\\n\\nI made my first painting acquisition and scheduled a trip to São Paulo to pick it up and meet the artist in person. In August 2021, during the pandemic, my wife and I visited the artist\\'s old 300m² apartment, which served as both a studio and residence. This turned out to be the luckiest moment of my life, defined as being in the right place at the right time with the right vision and attitude. The artist had a dispute with his former art dealer, and I seized the opportunity, buying nine paintings with every penny I had.\\n\\nIn December of the same year, the artist invited me to exhibit my collection at his first major solo exhibition in São Paulo in April. He also granted me priority to buy new works and handle the pre-sale, earning a 20% commission on sales. Despite being financially tight, I sold 20 paintings to friends and family in four days, acquiring three more with my commission. I then founded a \"collectors\\' club,\" taking responsibility for the next sale and tasks related to exhibitions and artwork storage.\\n\\nThe São Paulo exhibition was incredible, attracting over 15,000 visitors in a month. Our partnership solidified with a contract designating me as the commercial sector representative. The first part of my strategy was coming together—I now had a powerful collection capable of being exported. The question remained: how?\\n\\nI continued studying, improving my English, and found a Brazilian government program for exporting, offering free training. Simultaneously, I worked relentlessly to find works from previous collectors. In 2022, I found a collection in Rio de Janeiro at an incredible price.\\n\\nIn 2022, I continued handling sales to clients in Brazil, still without any sales from my collection. \\n\\nIn April 2023, the first sale to a foreign customer emerged—a collector from Texas who discovered me through Twitter. This individual acquired one painting from the artist\\'s collection and one from my collection (I will provide the values at the end). In my research, I found interesting marketplaces to list the artist\\'s collection, with Saatchiart being the most suitable. It didn\\'t take long, and in May, the first sale was completed to a customer in Denmark. However, we encountered a customs issue during the artwork shipment. I had to get in touch with the customer, leading to a better acquaintance. I introduced my collection, and the customer showed interest in two pieces, which I personally delivered to him in June.\\n\\nHere are the values of the three paintings that I have sold so far: \\n\\n1. Painting 1 - Purchase price: 200 USD (1/10 of the Rio de Janeiro collector\\'s collection) Selling price: 12,000 USD\\n2. Painting 2 - Purchase price: 720 USD (acquired from the artist with my commission during the São Paulo exhibition pre-sale) Selling price: 12,000 euros\\n3. Painting 3 - Purchase price: 2,100 USD (purchased from the artist in 2021) Selling price: 23,000 euros\\n\\nCurrently, I have 35 paintings in the club\\'s collection, and the next steps include an exhibition in Rio de Janeiro in August/24 and the first European exhibition in 2025. I hope this story inspires you to invest in what you believe in.\\n\\nIf I could offer four tips to those reading:\\n\\n1. Don\\'t listen to friends and family when starting a new, unusual project. They won\\'t understand until the first cent comes in, which may take years.\\n2. Study! Don\\'t just go for shallow and superficial content; be curious.\\n3. Be resilient. It may sound cliché, but it\\'s fundamental and real. I faced many difficulties until the first sale, over two years.\\n4. Be a diamond hand! Understand exactly how much your worth is and be willing to hold onto that value until the end. That\\'s what will provide a foundation for your wealth.\\n\\nI know that my sales are far below the values shown here, but I believe it\\'s just the tip of the iceberg. This is not just a story about numbers but about believing.\\n\\nWishing you much art and \"luck\" on your journey!',\n","     'author_fullname': 't2_vd3mq1dk',\n","     'saved': False,\n","     'mod_reason_title': None,\n","     'gilded': 0,\n","     'clicked': False,\n","     'title': 'More than 50x investing in art',\n","     'link_flair_richtext': [],\n","     'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/investing',\n","     'hidden': False,\n","     'pwls': 6,\n","     'link_flair_css_class': None,\n","     'downs': 0,\n","     'top_awarded_type': None,\n","     'hide_score': False,\n","     'name': 't3_195mq9a',\n","     'quarantine': False,\n","     'link_flair_text_color': 'dark',\n","     'upvote_ratio': 0.28,\n","     'author_flair_background_color': None,\n","     'subreddit_type': 'public',\n","     'ups': 0,\n","     'total_awards_received': 0,\n","     'media_embed': {},\n","     'author_flair_template_id': None,\n","     'is_original_content': False,\n","     'user_reports': [],\n","     'secure_media': None,\n","     'is_reddit_media_domain': False,\n","     'is_meta': False,\n","     'category': None,\n","     'secure_media_embed': {},\n","     'link_flair_text': None,\n","     'can_mod_post': False,\n","     'score': 0,\n","     'approved_by': None,\n","     'is_created_from_ads_ui': False,\n","     'author_premium': False,\n","     'thumbnail': '',\n","     'edited': False,\n","     'author_flair_css_class': None,\n","     'author_flair_richtext': [],\n","     'gildings': {},\n","     'content_categories': None,\n","     'is_self': True,\n","     'mod_note': None,\n","     'created': 1705148107.0,\n","     'link_flair_type': 'text',\n","     'wls': 6,\n","     'removed_by_category': None,\n","     'banned_by': None,\n","     'author_flair_type': 'text',\n","     'domain': 'self.investing',\n","     'allow_live_comments': False,\n","     'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the story of how I multiplied my investment by more than 50x by buying art.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This is the story of how I became an art dealer.

In August 2021, during the pandemic, my wife and I visited the artist&amp;#39;s old 300m² apartment, which served as both a studio and residence. This turned out to be the luckiest moment of my life, defined as being in the right place at the right time with the right vision and attitude. The artist had a dispute with his former art dealer, and I seized the opportunity, buying nine paintings with every penny I had.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In December of the same year, the artist invited me to exhibit my collection at his first major solo exhibition in São Paulo in April. He also granted me priority to buy new works and handle the pre-sale, earning a 20% commission on sales. Despite being financially tight, I sold 20 paintings to friends and family in four days, acquiring three more with my commission. I then founded a &amp;quot;collectors&amp;#39; club,&amp;quot; taking responsibility for the next sale and tasks related to exhibitions and artwork storage.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The São Paulo exhibition was incredible, attracting over 15,000 visitors in a month. Our partnership solidified with a contract designating me as the commercial sector representative. The first part of my strategy was coming together—I now had a powerful collection capable of being exported. The question remained: how?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I continued studying, improving my English, and found a Brazilian government program for exporting, offering free training. Simultaneously, I worked relentlessly to find works from previous collectors. In 2022, I found a collection in Rio de Janeiro at an incredible price.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In 2022, I continued handling sales to clients in Brazil, still without any sales from my collection. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In April 2023, the first sale to a foreign customer emerged—a collector from Texas who discovered me through Twitter. This individual acquired one painting from the artist&amp;#39;s collection and one from my collection (I will provide the values at the end). In my research, I found interesting marketplaces to list the artist&amp;#39;s collection, with Saatchiart being the most suitable. It didn&amp;#39;t take long, and in May, the first sale was completed to a customer in Denmark. However, we encountered a customs issue during the artwork shipment. I had to get in touch with the customer, leading to a better acquaintance. I introduced my collection, and the customer showed interest in two pieces, which I personally delivered to him in June.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Here are the values of the three paintings that I have sold so far: &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;ol&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Painting 1 - Purchase price: 200 USD (1/10 of the Rio de Janeiro collector&amp;#39;s collection) Selling price: 12,000 USD&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Painting 2 - Purchase price: 720 USD (acquired from the artist with my commission during the São Paulo exhibition pre-sale) Selling price: 12,000 euros&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Painting 3 - Purchase price: 2,100 USD (purchased from the artist in 2021) Selling price: 23,000 euros&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ol&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Currently, I have 35 paintings in the club&amp;#39;s collection, and the next steps include an exhibition in Rio de Janeiro in August/24 and the first European exhibition in 2025. I hope this story inspires you to invest in what you believe in.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;If I could offer four tips to those reading:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;ol&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#39;t listen to friends and family when starting a new, unusual project. They won&amp;#39;t understand until the first cent comes in, which may take years.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Study! Don&amp;#39;t just go for shallow and superficial content; be curious.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Be resilient. It may sound cliché, but it&amp;#39;s fundamental and real. I faced many difficulties until the first sale, over two years.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Be a diamond hand! Understand exactly how much your worth is and be willing to hold onto that value until the end. That&amp;#39;s what will provide a foundation for your wealth.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ol&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I know that my sales are far below the values shown here, but I believe it&amp;#39;s just the tip of the iceberg. This is not just a story about numbers but about believing.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Wishing you much art and &amp;quot;luck&amp;quot; on your journey!&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n","     'likes': None,\n","     'suggested_sort': None,\n","     'banned_at_utc': None,\n","     'view_count': None,\n","     'archived': False,\n","     'no_follow': True,\n","     'is_crosspostable': True,\n","     'pinned': False,\n","     'over_18': False,\n","     'all_awardings': [],\n","     'awarders': [],\n","     'media_only': False,\n","     'can_gild': False,\n","     'spoiler': False,\n","     'locked': False,\n","     'author_flair_text': None,\n","     'treatment_tags': [],\n","     'visited': False,\n","     'removed_by': None,\n","     'num_reports': None,\n","     'distinguished': None,\n","     'subreddit_id': 't5_2qhhq',\n","     'author_is_blocked': False,\n","     'mod_reason_by': None,\n","     'removal_reason': None,\n","     'link_flair_background_color': '',\n","     'id': '195mq9a',\n","     'is_robot_indexable': True,\n","     'report_reasons': None,\n","     'author': 'felipe_art',\n","     'discussion_type': None,\n","     'num_comments': 16,\n","     'send_replies': True,\n","     'whitelist_status': 'all_ads',\n","     'contest_mode': False,\n","     'mod_reports': [],\n","     'author_patreon_flair': False,\n","     'author_flair_text_color': None,\n","     'permalink': '/r/investing/comments/195mq9a/more_than_50x_investing_in_art/',\n","     'parent_whitelist_status': 'all_ads',\n","     'stickied': False,\n","     'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/195mq9a/more_than_50x_investing_in_art/',\n","     'subreddit_subscribers': 2497325,\n","     'created_utc': 1705148107.0,\n","     'num_crossposts': 1,\n","     'media': None,\n","     'is_video': False}},\n","   {'kind': 't3',\n","    'data': {'approved_at_utc': None,\n","     'subreddit': 'investing',\n","     'selftext': 'Have a general question?

In 2020, the Fed started expanding its balance sheet from $4 trillion to $9 trillion. That\\'s a lot of money. Let\\'s examine how this money is sloshing around in our financial system.\\n\\n1. First of all, when the Fed buys long-term bonds and puts them on its balance sheet, its taking those bonds off bank balance sheets and replacing them with bank reserves, while putting the bonds on its own balance sheet.\\n2. So a large chunk of QE money goes to increasing bank reserves\\n3. Bank reserve ratios go up, balance sheet costs go up, and banks try to shed bank reserves to earn a greater yield and reduce balance costs\\n4. They push a lot of money to money market funds (MMFs)\\n5. Interest rates start rising in March 2021 and US treasury isn\\'t issuing as much short-term debt, MMFs default to Fed\\'s Overnight Reverse Repo facility ON RRP for yield\\n6. ON RRP is an overnight loan and is a secure place to earn yield as interest rates go up. Since it resets every night, you don\\'t miss out on higher interest rates by commiting as soon as possible\\n7. On the other hand, short-term debt like US tbills are bad investments when interest rates are rising as their values will fall. MMFs don\\'t want to sell their assets at a loss from redemptions\\n8. So ON RRP balance starts rising to $2.4T from $0 in March 2021\\n9. Then, in June 2023, ON RRP balance starts falling and is now around $600 billion. That\\'s almost a $2 trillion fall! What happened?\\n10. Debt ceiling lifted in 2023 and US Treasury starts issuing a ton of tbills. At the same time, Fed stopped raising interest rates and rates started plateauing across the rate curve.\\n11. MMFs start investing in tbills again and pull out money from the ON RRP to do that\\n12. This ON RRP money being used to buy tbills will run out eventually and there will be a smaller bid for treasuries at the Treasury auctions. At the same time, the Fed is running QT, reducing bank reserves\\n13. This will result in bank reserves dwindling a lot and threaten to drop the financial system out of what\\'s known as the [\"ample reserves\" regime](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/implementing-monetary-policy-in-an-ample-reserves-regime-the-basics-note-1-of-3-20200701.html)\\n14. This is why the Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan suggested that the Fed will need to slow down QT in March when the ON RRP balance drops to low levels\\n\\nHopefully this is a helpful explanation on how the QE money is sloshing around in our financial system.
